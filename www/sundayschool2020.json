Having prayed for direction, he sensed the need for the community to seek a closer relationship with God in the New Year. He discussed with the pastor of his church and they agreed that the community should embark on three days prayer and fasting, for restoration. At the completion of the prayer session, many people, especially youths rededicated their lives to God. The climax of the event was that the entire church, under the leadership of the pastor, laid the foundation of a new church building, which was dedicated, at its completion, as a place of regular worship to God. Mr Samuel Davies used his position, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, not only to create a forum for spiritual reawakening but also for the dedication of a church building. Todays lesson focuses on how Solomon led the people of Israel to worship God after bringing the ark of the Lord to the temple. He summoned the elders, the priests and the Levites, and testified to the completion of the temple to the glory of God. The ark, in this context, served as the receptacle for the two tablets that contained the Ten Commandments, which were given to Moses at Mount Sinai and as the symbol of the divine presence of God guiding His people throughout their journeys.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p><strong>A. Solomon Summons the Elders 1 Kings 8:1-2<\/strong> Earlier on, King David, having settled in his palace, planned to build a house for the Lord where the ark of the covenant would be kept, but God did not approve of it. He promised to raise one of Davids offspring who will build a house for Him and establish his kingdom (1 Chronicles 17:1, 11-12). When Solomon (the chosen offspring) had completed the building of the temple, he gathered all the things his father, David, had dedicated (silver, gold and furnishings) and placed them in the treasury of the Lords temple (1 Kings 7:51). He, then, summoned the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families to Jerusalem purposely to lead in bringing the ark of the Lords covenant from Zion (v. 1). They assembled during the Festival of Shelters (Leviticus 23:33-43). Their worship was in remembrance of their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land, in the seventh month of Ethanim. The movement from Zion to Jerusalem represented the longawaited provision of a permanent place for the ark, which is the symbol of Gods presence with His people. The action and concern of King Solomon in moving the ark of the covenant to the temple in Jerusalem is quite commendable. The effort, promptness and obedience of the elders to his call is also praiseworthy. These days, some church elders no longer give much attention to the things of God like they do to sociopolitical issues. They leave spiritual matters to women and youths while they pursue other matters. Solomon involved the elders because he knew the vital role they would play in bringing the ark, the symbol of Gods presence, to Zion. In like manner, Christians should pray and work to ensure the restoration of the glory of God in families, churches and communities. Mature believers should rise and take their place in order to move the church and Gods work forward instead of shifting blames.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

What lesson does this teach contemporary Christian leaders?<\/p>\r\n","lesson2":"<p><strong>B. Moving the Ark to the Temple 1 Kings 8:3-8<\/strong> The movement of the ark to the temple in Jerusalem was in stages. All the elders of Israel gathered and took turns to perform their various duties. According to verse 3, the priests carried the ark. The priests and Levites moved the ark of God with all the sacred furnishings to the Temple. King Solomon and all the people of Israel responded as they assembled; they sacrificed countless number of sheep and cattle. The covenant box was placed in the Most Holy Place, under the wings of the cherubim, who spread their wings over the place of the ark and covered the ark and its poles (v. 8). The reason for the great celebration was Gods presence among His people. It was a reminder of the covenant God made with them at Mount Sinai. The division of labour, which was adopted by Solomon is also praiseworthy; Each group identified their assigned work and was committed to it. The orderliness and decorum demonstrated in carrying the ark (vv. 3-4) should serve as a lesson to churches where decorum during worship has been thrown to the winds. Whenever we gather to worship, we should do so with decorum and be conscious of the presence of God so that our worship will be acceptable to Him.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

Gods Glory Revealed 1 Kings 8:9-13<\/strong> The ark of the covenant of God was special to the people of Israel because of its symbolic representation of Gods presence with His people. It contained the two tablets of stones of the Ten Commandments, which God gave to them (v. 9). The ark is said to have preserved the stone tablets of the covenant as instructed by God in Exodus 25:16; 40:20. As the priests were leaving the temple, the glory of God, in form of a cloud shinning with dazzling light (signifying the presence of God), filled the temple. It was so overwhelming that the people could not perform their duties such as offering incense on the altar to consecrate it. Solomon was also overwhelmed with the experience. In the mood of worship, he said, The LORD has said he would dwell in a dark cloud; I have indeed built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell forever. (vv. 12-13) The appearance of the cloud can be interpreted as a sign of Gods approval and blessing upon the new place of worship. God reveals Himself to His people in diverse ways. The worship experience of the people of Israel was so unique that the glory of Gods manifestation prevented them from performing their duties in the temple. It was indeed a sign of the presence of Jehovah, the covenant-keeping God who made the temple His permanent place of worship for the people of Israel. In verse 13, Solomon extols this marvellous proof of Gods favour and presence in his prayer that he had built the house to be Gods dwelling place forever (v. 13). The glory of God will be revealed to Christians when we worship Him in spirit and in truth, walk in His ways and offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and praise to Him.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1.

They speak with disregard for the person of God who has made them prosper. They beat their chests arrogantly and allow the empty applause of men get into their heads, thereby raising their ego to their shame and destruction. The story in Acts 12:20-23 is a good example. The people of Tyre and Sidon sought audience with Herod in order to end the long-standing quarrel they had with him because they depended on his country for their food supply. On the appointed day Herod was to address them, he wore his royal robe and sat on his throne. His speech was with so much arrogance and at the same time horrifying that the people shouted: This is the voice of a god, not of a man. He did not acknowledge God in his speech or give praise to Him. As a result, an angel of the Lord struck him and he was eaten by worms and he died. This is in contrast to the speech made by King Solomon in todays lesson. Speech is like a talk given to an audience. Todays lesson focuses on the speech of Solomon during worship when the temple was dedicated. The passage articulates three major components in his speech: he acknowledged God as a covenant-keeping God. He recalled the history that led to the building of the temple and saw it as a promise to his father, David, which was fulfilled by God. Solomons speech was an act of worship, which stands out among some self-centred speeches made by some leaders today.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p><strong>A. Solomons Speech of Praise 1 Kings 8:14-16<\/strong> Last week, our focus was on how Solomon led the people of Israel to worship as the ark was brought into the temple. We also considered the roles played by the Israelite elders, and how the glory of God overwhelmed the temple (1 Kings 8:10). Todays lesson is centred on Solomons speech of praise to God. As they witnessed the glory of God in the temple, he blessed the people and said, Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who with his own hand has fulfilled what he promised with his own mouth to my father David.(1 Kings 8:15) This statement refers to Gods promise to David to raise up his offspring to succeed him and establish his kingdom. He also promised he would be the one to build a house for His Name (2 Samuel 7:12-13). Solomon began his worship in the temple with an attitude of thanksgiving to God. He acknowledged His faithfulness as reflected in the phrase: Praise be to the keeping their promises while others intentionally do not bother about such promises. Solomon spoke with a heart of praise to God for providing the temple as a place of worship, where the ark would be kept. This implies that, although God is Spirit, Christians should have a place in their hearts for Him to dwell (2 Corinthians 6:14-16). Another lesson is that putting the history of our church in proper perspective is of great value because it enhances worship. It provides new church members and gives younger generations the opportunity to be familiar with the history of the church and respond in worship to God. This attitude will influence subsequent generations not to see the church as an ordinary building but as a revered place for the purpose of worship.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

He shared his vision with the church and the building work started in earnest. After about two years, the project was completed with all the modern facilities in place. In preparation for the dedication of the ultra-modern building, as it was popularly called by members of the church, a five-man committee was constituted to pray and plan the programme with some terms of reference. The last day of the programme was full of fun, excitement, eating, drinking and entertainment of guests who had travelled from far and near to witness the occasion. The conference president, who was specially invited, offered the prayer of dedication. The pastor led the members to sing songs of praises to God for fulfilling His promise. The story of Gods Family Baptist Church is similar to that of the people of Israel, under the leadership of King Solomon. After moving the ark of the covenant to the temple, Solomon offered a prayer of dedication to God for fulfilling His promise. The purpose of a prayer of dedication is to set aside or devote something mainly for the use of God. The prayer Solomon offered emphasised the importance of the temple as a place of worship and Gods dwelling place. Solomon carefully chose his words and avoided the display of extreme emotion, instead he praised God for keeping His promise. He also pleaded with God to hear their prayers because of the favour He has shown by choosing them among other nations of the world to be His people (v. 53).<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p><strong>A.        Solomon    Eulogises    God 1    Kings    8:22-24<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The    completion    of    the    temple    in    Jerusalem    under    the    reign    of    King    Solomon    remains    <br  \/>\r\nmemorable     in     the     history     of     the     people     of     Israel.     In     the     presence     of     the     whole    <br  \/>\r\nassembly,    Solomon    stood    before    the    altar    and    lifted    his    hands    towards    heaven    and    <br  \/>\r\nprayed.    In    praise    to    God    he    said,    O    LORD,    God    of    Israel,    there    is    no    God    like    you    in    <br  \/>\r\n__ heaven    above    or    on    earth    below       you    who    keep    your    covenant    of    love    with    your    <br  \/>\r\nservants    who    continue    wholeheartedly    in    your    way. (v.    23)    In    verse    24,    he    extolled    <br  \/>\r\nGods    faithfulness    and    truth    in    keeping    to    the    promise    He    made    to    David    his    father    <br  \/>\r\nsaying,    With    your    mouth    you    have    promised    and    with    your    hand    you    have    fulfilled    it    <br  \/>\r\nas    it    is    today.    This    is    a    reference    to    Gods    promise    to    David    that    he    (Solomon)    is    the    <br  \/>\r\none     who     will     build     a     house     for     His     Name     and     will     establish     the     throne     of     His    <br  \/>\r\nkingdom    forever    (2    Samuel    7:13).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He    recognised    the    supremacy    of    God    above    all    others,    (2    Samuel    7:22;    22:32)    <br  \/>\r\nand    affirmed    that    the    God    of    Israel    has    no    equal    in    heaven    above    or    on    earth    below    <br  \/>\r\n(v.    22).

Suddenly,    he    transited    from    praise    to    pleading    for    the    fulfilment    of    Gods    <br  \/>\r\npromise    to    David    that    he    shall    never    fail    to    have    a    man    to    sit    on    the    throne    of    Israel    <br  \/>\r\n(vv.     25-26;     cf.     2     Samuel     7:12-16).

(v.    25)    Solomon    was    specific    in    his    <br  \/>\r\nappeal.    According    to    verse    26,    he    said,    And    now,    O    God    of    Israel,    let    your    word    that    <br  \/>\r\nyou    promised    your    servant    David    my    father    come    true.    Solomon    asked    the    question:    <br  \/>\r\nWill    God    really    dwell    on    earth?    This    was    to    affirm    that    the    temple    he    has    built    <br  \/>\r\ncannot    contain    God    and    to    appreciate    the    privilege    of    being    chosen    to    build    the    <br  \/>\r\ntemple.    Nevertheless,    he    made    an    appeal    to    God    to    make    His    presence    known    in    the    <br  \/>\r\ntemple.    In    verses    28-30    He    said:<br  \/>\r\n\u00b7    Listen    to    my    prayer    and    grant    the    request    of    my    heart;<br  \/>\r\n\u00b7    Watch    over    the    temple    day    and    night    so    that    the    prayers    of    the    people    shall    be    <br  \/>\r\nheard;<br  \/>\r\n\u00b7    Hear    the    supplication    of    your    servant    and    of    the    people    of    Israel    whenever    they    <br  \/>\r\npray    and    call    on    your    name;<br  \/>\r\n\u00b7    Forgive    the    sins    of    the    people.    <br  \/>\r\nA    careful    analysis    of    the    components    of    Solomons    prayer    reveals    that    he    was    honest    and    not    self-seeking.    He    recognised    the    temple    as    a    place    of    worship    and    a    <br  \/>\r\nsymbol    of    the    presence    of    God    among    His    people.    He    attested    to    the    Scripture    that    <br  \/>\r\nsays    that    God    cannot    be    contained    to    a    single    location    (Acts    17:24).        <br  \/>\r\nPrayer    is    an    honest    appeal,    entreaty    or    conversation    with    God.    Its    components    <br  \/>\r\nare    usually    adoration,    confession,    thanksgiving    and    supplication.    From    Solomons    <br  \/>\r\nprayer,    we    can    see    he    had    a    grasp    of    the    concept    of    the    omnipresence    and    infinite    <br  \/>\r\nnature     of     God     (Psalm     139:7-10;     Isaiah     66:1).

The    major    lesson    believers    should    learn    from    Solomons    prayer    is    <br  \/>\r\nsincerity,    selfless    attitude,    recognition    and    appreciation    of    the    faithfulness    of    God.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

Favoured    without    Merit 1    Kings    8:52-53<br\/>\r\nSolomon's    petition    to    God    to    hear    the    prayer    of    His    people    and    the    plea    to    forgive    <br\/>\r\ntheir    sins    continued    up    to    verse    51.    He    acknowledged    that    the    people    were    God's    <br\/>\r\ninheritance    whom    He    brought    out    of    Egypt.    Therefore,    he    pleaded    on    their    behalf    <br\/>\r\nsaying,    'May    your    eyes    be    open    to    your    servant's    plea    and    to    the    plea    of    your    people    <br\/>\r\nIsrael,    and    may    you    listen    to    them    whenever    they    cry    out    to    you.' (v.    52)    The    focus    of    his    <br\/>\r\nrequest    was    for    God    to    look    upon    His    people,    Israel,    with    mercy    and    undeserved    <br\/>\r\nfavour.    It    was    indeed    a    cry    that    conveyed    his    longing    and    deep    wish    for    their    prayers    <br\/>\r\nto    be    answered,    despite    their    sins.    To    justify    his    appeal    for    forgiveness,    Solomon    <br\/>\r\nmade    reference    to    God's    choice    of    Israel    among    other    nations    of    the    world    to    be    His    <br\/>\r\ntreasured    possession    through    His    servant    Moses,    when    He    brought    them    out    of    <br\/>\r\nEgypt    (Exodus    19:5).        <br\/>\r\nSolomon's    request    was    from    a    sincere    and    humble    heart.    The    expression    in    <br\/>\r\nverse    53    underscores    the    value    he    attached    to    God's    choice    of    the    Israelites    as    His    <br\/>\r\ntreasured    possession    (Deuteronomy    9:26,    29;    14).    This    is    a    reminder    that    Christians    <br\/>\r\nare     to     value     the     salvation     bequeathed     to     them     through     faith     in     Christ     Jesus    <br\/>\r\n(Ephesians    2:8-9).    Solomon    did    not    only    dedicate    the    temple    for    worship,    he    also    re-<br\/>\r\ndedicated     the     people's     relationship     with     God.

Instead    of    worshipping    God    and    giving    Him    praise    for    who    He    is,    more    emphasis    is    on    the    death    of    enemies,    <br\/>\r\nprosperity,     fund-raising     and     political     matters.     Christians     should     learn     from    <br\/>\r\nSolomon's    modest    prayer    and    always    show    gratitude    to    God    in    worship.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1.

There    is    nobody    that    has    not    <br  \/>\r\nbeen    tempted    or    cannot    be    tempted.

Jesus    First    Temptation Matthew    4:1-4<br  \/>\r\nAfter    the    baptism    of    Jesus    by    John    the    Baptist    (Matthew    3:13-17),    Jesus    was    publicly    <br  \/>\r\ndeclared    the    Son    of    God    after    which    He    was    led    into    the    wilderness    where    He    fasted    <br  \/>\r\nfor    forty    days    and    forty    nights.    The    Devil    knew    Jesus    was    hungry    after    the    fasting    <br  \/>\r\nexercise,    so    he    capitalised    on    that    to    tempt    Him.    He    said    to    Him,    If    you    are    the    Son    of    <br  \/>\r\nGod,    tell    these    stones    to    become    bread.    (v.    3)    In    other    words,    Satans    suggestion    to    <br  \/>\r\nJesus    was    for    Him    to    prove    His    sonship    but    Jesus    used    appropriate    Scripture    to    <br  \/>\r\nnullify    Satans    attempt    to    lure    Him    into    sin.    He    said    to    Satan,    It    is    written:    Man    shall    <br  \/>\r\nnot     live     on     bread     alone,     but     on     every     word     that     comes     from     the     mouth     of     God.    <br  \/>\r\nAlthough    Jesus    had    the    power    to    command    the    stones    to    become    bread,    He    chose    <br  \/>\r\nnot    to    misuse    His    divine    power    on    insignificant    things.    <\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<ul>\r\n <li>Satan    took    Jesus    to    a    high    mountain    to    be    tempted.

Jesus    Third    Temptation    and    Victory Matthew    4:8-10<br  \/>\r\nThe    Devil    made    another    attempt    to    distract    Jesus    from    His    God-approved    purpose.    <br  \/>\r\nHe    graciously    offered    to    give    Jesus    the    kingdoms    of    the    world,    if    He    would    bow    and    <br  \/>\r\nworship    him    (v.    9),    probably    as    the    prince    and    ruler    of    this    world    (John    12:31).    Jesus    <br  \/>\r\nknew    the    Devils    intention    and    as    God,    He    would    not    condescend    low    to    bow    and    <br  \/>\r\nworship    the    Devil.    Had    He    made    a    cheap    bid    for    popularity    instead    of    yielding    to    His    <br  \/>\r\ninitial    plan    of    self-sacrifice,    He    would    have    acted    against    His    Fathers    will,    which    <br  \/>\r\nwas    the    aim    of    the    Devil.    His    response    was    remarkable.    He    said,    Away    from    me,    <br  \/>\r\nSatan!     For     it     is     written:     Worship     the     Lord     your     God,     and     serve     him     only. (v.     10;    <br  \/>\r\nDeuteronomy    6:13)    Immediately,    the    Devil    left    Him    and    angels    came    and    attended    <br  \/>\r\nto    Him.    The    fact    that    Jesus    was    tempted    did    not    reduce    His    status    as    God.    Rather,    it    <br  \/>\r\nwas    a    proof    of    His    perfection,    even    as    a    human    being.<br  \/>\r\nJesus    was    tempted    by    the    Devil    three    times,    but    in    all,    He    overcame    using    the    <br  \/>\r\nWord    of    God.    He    demonstrated    single-minded    obedience    to    God,    He    was    firm    and    <br  \/>\r\nnot    willing    to    deny    the    right    of    His    sonship.    He    made    the    Devil    know    that    God    alone    <br  \/>\r\nis    worthy    to    be    worshipped.    The    temptations    presented    Him    with    a    platform    to    <br  \/>\r\nreaffirm    Gods    purpose    for    His    ministry,    which    by    extension    has    offered    us    example    <br  \/>\r\nto    follow    when    we    are    tempted.    Christians    can    overcome    temptations    by    knowing,    <br  \/>\r\nbelieving    and    using    the    Word    of    God,    like    Jesus    did.    He    knew    the    Scripture    and    its    <br  \/>\r\nauthority;    hence    He    was    able    to    defeat    the    Devil.    We    should    regularly    engage    in    <br  \/>\r\nspiritual    discipline    like    fasting,    praying,    in-depth    studying    of    the    Word    of    God    and    <br  \/>\r\nmeditating    on    it    so    that    we    can    withstand    temptations    that    may    come    our    way,    as    no    <br  \/>\r\none    is    immune    from    temptation.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

They    are    spiritual    <br  \/>\r\nexercises    that    enhance    believers    relationship    with    God.    While    Jesus    warned    against    <br  \/>\r\nthe    misuse    of    these    acts,    He    also    taught    the    conditions    for    the    acceptability    of    these    <br  \/>\r\nservices    to    God.

Instructions    on    Alms-giving Matthew    6:1-4<br  \/>\r\nJesus    teaching    was    all-encompassing,    beginning    from    Matthew    chapter    5    where    He    <br  \/>\r\ntaught    His    disciples    some    kingdom    principles.    He    continued    in    chapter    6    from    verse    <br  \/>\r\n1    but    with    a    stern    warning    about    the    acceptable    and    unacceptable    ways    to    practise    <br  \/>\r\nalms-giving    to    the    needy.    He    said,    Be    careful    not    to    do    your    acts    of    righteousness    <br  \/>\r\nbefore    men,    to    be    seen    by    them.    If    you    do,    you    will    have    no    reward    from    your    Father    in    <br  \/>\r\nheaven.    According    to    Him,    alms-giving    should    not    be    done    to    attract    mens    attention    <br  \/>\r\nand    public    applause,    as    it    was    the    attitude    of    hypocrites    in    the    synagogue.    Their    <br  \/>\r\nconcern    was    to    be    honoured    by    men    (v.    3).    However,    Jesus    affirmed    that    any    giving    <br  \/>\r\nthat    is    done    for    public    praise    is    not    acceptable    to    God    and    will    not    attract    any    reward    <br  \/>\r\nfrom    God.    As    He    discouraged    public    display    of    giving,    He    recommended    that    our    <br  \/>\r\ngiving    should    be    made    secret    so    that    our    Father,    who    sees    what    is    done    in    secret,    will    <br  \/>\r\nreward    the    giver.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

Instructions    on    Fasting     Matthew    6:16-18<\/strong><br  \/>\r\nAnother    spiritual    discipline    that    was    greatly    cherished    and    practised    by    the    Jews    <br  \/>\r\nwas    fasting.    It    is    a    spiritual    exercise    that    requires    abstinence    from    certain    daily    <br  \/>\r\npleasures,    especially    food    and    water,    for    a    period    of    time.    Jesus    had    set    the    example    <br  \/>\r\nof     the     necessity     of     fasting     when     He     fasted     forty     days     and     forty     nights,     in     the    <br  \/>\r\nwilderness    (Matthew    4:1-2).    But    according    to    the    passage,    He    called    for    caution    <br  \/>\r\nwhen    fasting    so    that    it    will    be    an    acceptable    and    rewarding    exercise.    He    was    very    <br  \/>\r\nspecific    in    verse    16.    He    said    to    them,    When    you    fast,    do    not    look    somber    as    the    <br  \/>\r\nhypocrites     do,     for     they     disfigure     their     faces     to     show     men     they     are     fasting.     He    <br  \/>\r\nconcluded     that     those     who     do     such     have     received     their     reward     in     full     measure.    <br  \/>\r\nHowever,    He    suggested    the    perfect    way    of    fasting.    When    you    fast,    put    oil    on    your    <br  \/>\r\nhead    and    wash    your    face,    so    that    it    will    not    be    obvious    to    men    that    you    are    fasting,    but    <br  \/>\r\nonly    to    your    Father,    who    is    unseen;    and    your    Father,    who    sees    what    is    done    in    secret,    <br  \/>\r\nwill    reward    you.    (vv.    17-18)<br  \/>\r\nFasting    is    a    required    spiritual    exercise    for    every    believer    but    it    must    be    done    <br  \/>\r\nwith    caution.    Applying    oil    on    the    head    during    fasting    as    used    in    this    passage    does    <br  \/>\r\nnot    necessarily    connote    the    physical    oil.    Rather,    Jesus    means    that    the    faces    of    those    <br  \/>\r\nwho    are    fasting    should    look    bright    so    as    not    to    make    it    obvious    to    people    that    they    <br  \/>\r\nare     fasting.     Unfortunately,     many     Christians     engage     in     regular     fasting     without    <br  \/>\r\nresults    because    they    lack    the    understanding    of    how    it    should    be    done.    Therefore,    <br  \/>\r\nwhen    we    fast,    we    should    be    careful    about    making    it    obvious    to    the    public,    otherwise    <br  \/>\r\nthe    exercise    will    be    in    futility.

The    ministry    mainly    teaches    Christians    how    to    pray    <br\/>\r\naccording    to    biblical    standard.    Initially,    many    people    murmured    and    began    to    <br\/>\r\nask    questions,    whether    prayers    are    taught    or    learned.

What    does    it    remind    or    teach    you?    <br\/>\r\nThe     song     above     teaches     the     importance     of     prayer     in     Christian     living.     It    <br\/>\r\nemphasises    how    Jesus    taught    His    disciples    'to    pray'    at    the    commencement    of    His    <br\/>\r\nearthly    ministry,    in    Matthew    chapter    6,    from    verse    9    to    13.    The    prayer    is    known    <br\/>\r\ntoday    as    'The    Lord's    Prayer'    commonly    recited    by    Christians.    The    song    serves    as    an    <br\/>\r\nencouragement    to    believers    to    always    seek    the    face    of    God    through    prayer,    in    order    <br\/>\r\nto    derive    strength.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A.    Praying    According    to    Kingdom    Pattern Matthew    6:9-10<br\/>\r\nJesus    did    not    leave    His    followers    in    the    dark    about    kingdom    principles.    As    He    taught    <br\/>\r\nHis     followers     charity,     He     also     taught     them     how     they     ought     to     pray     according     to    <br\/>\r\nkingdom    standard.    The    prayer    is    popularly    known    as    'The    Lord's    Prayer'    and    it    is    <br\/>\r\ndivided    into    different    segments.    The    first    phrase    is    an    acknowledgment    of    God    as    <br\/>\r\n'Our     Father     in     heaven'     whose     name     must     be     highly     honoured.     It     serves     two    <br\/>\r\npurposes:    that    Christians    should    see    God    as    their    Father    and    give    reverence    to    Him    in    <br\/>\r\ntheir    prayers.    In    other    words,    in    prayers,    God    should    be    appreciated    and    honoured    <br\/>\r\nfor    who    He    is    and    what    He    does.    The    second    segment    focuses    on    the    coming    of    the    <br\/>\r\nkingdom    of    God    on    earth    and    that    His    will    should    be    done    on    earth    as    it    is    in    heaven.    <br\/>\r\nThis     is     a     reference     to     the     future     consummation     of     the     kingdom.     This     can     be    <br\/>\r\ninterpreted     to     mean     that     as     Christians     are     eager     for     the     manifestation     of     the    <br\/>\r\nkingdom    of    God    in    their    prayer,    this    will    enable    them    to    submit    to    His    will.    <br\/>\r\nJesus'    effort    to    teach    His    disciples    to    pray    is    a    reminder    of    the    relevance    of    <br\/>\r\nprayer    in    the    Christian    journey.    The    first    three    petitions    show    that    above    everything    <br\/>\r\nelse,    Jesus'    followers    want    God    to    rule    on    earth,    with    all    people    acknowledging    Him    <br\/>\r\nas    sovereign    Lord    and    doing    His    will.    Having    the    desire    to    do    the    will    of    God    guides    <br\/>\r\nChristians     and     assures     us     that     our     request     through     prayers     to     God     will     receive    <br\/>\r\nanswers.    In    addition,    when    the    kingdom    of    God    is    made    manifest    on    earth    and    in    the    <br\/>\r\nhearts    of    believers,    we    will    do    His    will    and    become    reference    points    to    others.

Praying    for    Physical    Needs    and    Victory Matthew    6:11-13<br\/>\r\nJesus'     model     of     prayer     was     in     stages     with     different     demands     and     requests.    <br\/>\r\nAccording    to    the    passage,    this    section    can    be    analysed    in    the    following    ways:<br\/>\r\n\u00b7     Jesus     emphasised     the     provision     of     daily     bread,     which     may     represent     the    <br\/>\r\nnecessities    of    life    and    not    necessarily    a    life    of    extravagance.    <br\/>\r\n\u00b7     A    plea    for    the    forgiveness    of    their    sins    as    they    have    forgiven    their    debtors.    <br\/>\r\nThe    tendency    to    get    revenge    for    evil    is    high    among    Christians.    Thus    Jesus    <br\/>\r\ntaught    about    forgiving    one    another    so    that    we    too    will    receive    forgiveness.<br\/>\r\n\u00b7     A    plea    for    deliverance    from    temptation.    We    are    daily    surrounded    by    tempting    <br\/>\r\nissues    that    are    capable    of    luring    believers    into    sin.    Therefore,    we    must    pray    <br\/>\r\ncontinuously    for    deliverance    from    falling    into    sin,    which    is    the    target    of    the    <br\/>\r\nDevil.<br\/>\r\n__<br\/>\r\n\u00b7     A    plea    for    protection    from    the    evil    one:    We    live    in    a    wicked    society    were    evils    <br\/>\r\nlike    incessant    killings,    kidnappings,    and    human    rituals    perpetually    prevail.    <br\/>\r\nTherefore,    the    need    for    Christians    to    pray    for    divine    protection    has    become    <br\/>\r\nnecessary.    <br\/>\r\nA    careful    analysis    of    this    prayer    reminds    Christians    that    we    have    different    needs    to    <br\/>\r\nbe    met    on    daily    basis    and    the    obligation    to    present    them    to    God    through    prayers.    He    <br\/>\r\nis     able     to     meet     our     needs,     especially     when     they     are     in     line     with     His     will.    <br\/>\r\nFurthermore,    the    subject    of    forgiveness    is    emphasised    in    verse    11.    According    to    <br\/>\r\nJesus'     statement,     believers     in     Christ     cannot     be     reconciled     to     God     unless     we     are    <br\/>\r\nreconciled     to     one     another     (Matthew     5:23-24;     6:14-15).     In     other     words,     an    <br\/>\r\nunforgiving    person    does    not    deserve    to    be    forgiven.    God    is    able    to    meet    all    human    <br\/>\r\nneeds    including    physical    needs    when    we    present    them    to    Him    according    to    His    will.    <\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

The    Necessity    of    Forgiveness Matthew    6:14-15<br\/>\r\nThe     last     aspect     of     Jesus'     prayer     focuses     on     forgiveness     as     a     requirement     for    <br\/>\r\nreceiving    forgiveness    from    our    Father.    He    said,    'For    if    you    forgive    men    when    they    sin    <br\/>\r\nagainst    you,    your    heavenly    Father    will    also    forgive    you.    But    if    you    do    not    forgive    men    <br\/>\r\ntheir    sins,    your    heavenly    Father    will    not    forgive    your    sins.' In    our    relationship    on    daily    basis,    we    may    not    be    able    to    avoid    offending    one    another    and    the    tendency    to    keep    <br\/>\r\nmalice.    But    what    is    important,    based    on    Jesus'    teaching,    is    to    forgive    our    offenders    <br\/>\r\nso    that    our    heavenly    Father    will    also    forgive    us.    According    to    Him,    humankind    can    <br\/>\r\nreceive    forgiveness    from    God    only    after    they    have    forgiven    their    offenders.<br\/>\r\nChristians    should    constantly    remember    that    unforgiveness    hinders    answers    to    <br\/>\r\nprayers.    Although    it    is    natural    for    people    to    avenge    any    evil    done    to    them,    Jesus    <br\/>\r\nadmonished     believers     to     first     settle     the     grudge     they     might     hold     against     people    <br\/>\r\nbefore     offering     their     gifts     at     the     altar     (Matthew     5:23-24).     In     essence,     forgiving    <br\/>\r\nothers    is    a    prerequisite    to    receiving    answers    to    prayers    and    ultimately    receiving    <br\/>\r\nforgiveness    from    God.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1.

Having     listened     to     her    <br  \/>\r\ncomplaints,    the    pastor    affirmed    Gods    goodness    and    readiness    to    hear    the    cry    of    His    <br  \/>\r\nchildren.    He    encouraged    her    to    persevere    and    not    relent    in    seeking    the    face    of    God    <br  \/>\r\nconcerning    her    challenges.    Few    months    later,    the    woman    testified    of    the    faithfulness    <br  \/>\r\nof    God    over    her    challenges    with    joy,    confidence    and    with    the    conclusion    that    God    <br  \/>\r\nonly    tested    her    faith.    She    expressed    gratitude    to    the    pastor    for    his    encouragement    to    <br  \/>\r\npersist    in    prayer.<br  \/>\r\nTodays    lesson    is    another    eye-opener    to    the    importance    of    perseverance    in    <br  \/>\r\nprayer.    Sometimes,    God    does    not    give    quick    answers    to    the    prayers    of    His    children.    <br  \/>\r\nHe    may    want    to    test    our    patience,    like    the    case    of    the    woman    in    the    story    above.    The    <br  \/>\r\nsummary    of    the    lesson    is    that    it    pays    to    pray    but    more    gainful    to    persevere    in    prayer.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A.        Persistence    in    Prayers    Encouraged Luke    11:5-8<br  \/>\r\nJesus     taught     His     disciples     how     to     pray     in     response     to     the     request     of     one     of     His    <br  \/>\r\ndisciples    (Luke    11:1-4).    Thereafter,    He    told    them    a    parable    to    explain    the    role    of    <br  \/>\r\nboldness    and    persistence    in    prayers.    The    man    in    the    parable    is    presented    as    having    a    <br  \/>\r\nvisitor    who    was    on    a    journey    but    stopped    to    spend    a    night    with    his    friend.    According    <br  \/>\r\nto    the    Jewish    custom,    hospitality    was    an    important    aspect    of    worship.    Perhaps    this    <br  \/>\r\npropelled    the    man    who    probably    did    not    have    what    he    needed    to    entertain    his    guest    <br  \/>\r\nto    approach    his    sleeping    friend    in    order    to    meet    his    obligation    to    a    travelling    friend.    <br  \/>\r\nThough    reluctant    initially    (v.    7),    the    friend    eventually    acceded    to    his    request.    Two    <br  \/>\r\nthings     can     be     identified     as     the     reasons     for     granting     the     request:     boldness     and    <br  \/>\r\npersistence.     Jesus,     therefore,     maintains     that     God     is     much     more     moved     when    <br  \/>\r\nbelievers    approach    Him    with    boldness    and    pray    persistently.    If    humans,    who    are    <br  \/>\r\nwicked    by    nature,    could    be    moved    to    meet    the    needs    of    one    another;    God,    whose    <br  \/>\r\nnature    is    goodness    will    do    much    more    when    His    children    pray    persistently.    To    persevere    in    prayer    is    the    same    as    to    keep    on    asking    until    the    request    is    <br  \/>\r\ngranted,    like    the    example    of    the    woman    in    the    story    above.    Therefore,    we    can    say    <br  \/>\r\nthat     boldness     and     persistence     are     important     attributes     believers     must     exhibit    <br  \/>\r\nwhenever    we    pray.    This    alludes    to    the    fact    that    the    person    has    faith    in    God    that    He    <br  \/>\r\ncan    do    all    things,    no    matter    how    difficult.    It    is    also    an    indication    that    the    person    is    <br  \/>\r\nserious.     Christians     should     see     prayer     as     an     element     of     worship     and,     therefore,    <br  \/>\r\ncultivate    the    habit    of    praying    persistently    until    their    needs    are    met.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

He    was    explicit    in    His    assurance    in    verse    9.

Even    if    our    earthly    fathers    would    provide    our    needs,    God    would    do    much    <br  \/>\r\nmore     to     meet     the     needs     of     His     children.     Consequently,     believers     should     be    <br  \/>\r\npersistent    in    prayer    and    not    be    tired    of    asking,    seeking    and    knocking    the    door    of    <br  \/>\r\nheaven     until     they     receive.

The    Demand    of    the    Lord Amos    5:21-24<br  \/>\r\nGod    did    not    relent    in    His    attempt    to    expose    the    wickedness    of    the    people    of    Israel    <br  \/>\r\nand    to    call    them    to    remember    the    day    of    the    Lord,    through    Prophet    Amos.    Having    <br  \/>\r\ndescribed    the    awful    nature    of    the    day,    the    Lord    became    more    specific    in    verse    21    and    <br  \/>\r\nstated    His    demand.    He    said,    I    hate,    I    despise    your    religious    feasts;    I    cannot    stand    your    <br  \/>\r\nassemblies.    To    hate    is    the    same    as    to    abhor    or    detest    something;    and    to    despise    <br  \/>\r\nis     to     reject     something     as     disgusting.     Therefore,     because     God     hates     their     vain    <br  \/>\r\nceremonies,    their    burnt    and    grain    offerings    will    not    be    acceptable,    not    even    their    <br  \/>\r\nchoice     fellowship     offerings.     Also,     God     will     reject     their     music     of     harps,     which     is    <br  \/>\r\nregarded    as    noise.    The    problem    of    Israel    and    their    leaders    was    not    their    style    of    <br  \/>\r\nworship,    religious    festivals,    their    solemn    assemblies,    the    giving    of    different    kinds    of    <br  \/>\r\nofferings,     singing     of     hymns     and     praises     with     all     the     musical     instruments;     their    <br  \/>\r\nmajor    problem    was    their    refusal    to    pay    apt    attention    to    the    sufferings    of    the    poor,    <br  \/>\r\nthe    widows,    the    orphans,    and    the    helpless    among    them.    These    set    of    people    were    <br  \/>\r\ntreated    with    disdain    and    contempt.    Thus    God    described    their    worship    as    vain.

This    happened    after    the    <br  \/>\r\n__ religious    reforms    of    King    Josiah    (2    Kings    23:36 24:4).

The    phrase    how    <br  \/>\r\nlong    suggests    that    Habakkuk    had    persevered    and    had    possibly    cried    for    a    long    time,    <br  \/>\r\nwithout    Gods    intervention.<br  \/>\r\nProphet    Habakkuk    was    concerned    about    the    apparent    weakness    of    the    Law    <br  \/>\r\nof    Moses    and    its    inability    to    bring    about    justice.    He    assumed    God    is    indifferent    to    the    <br  \/>\r\nwickedness    in    the    land    and    he    was    prompted    to    say,    How    long?

Even     today,     there     is     high     level     of     corruption,     incessant     killings,    <br  \/>\r\nviolence,     destruction     of     properties,     kidnappings,     armed     robbery,     injustice,     hate    <br  \/>\r\nspeeches,    and    immorality    in    our    land.

His    cry    for    justice    and    Gods    plan    to    use    the    <br  \/>\r\nBabylonians    as    a    rod    of    discipline    against    Judah    is    seen    in    verses    5-6.    He    was    deeply    <br  \/>\r\namazed    and    disappointed    at    Gods    reply.    His    argument    was    how    a    holy    and    just    God    <br  \/>\r\nwill    use    a    nation    as    evil    and    wicked    as    Babylon    to    punish    Judah,    which    is    more    <br  \/>\r\nrighteous.    In    verse    1,    he    acknowledged    God    as    everlasting,    his    God,    the    Holy    One    <br  \/>\r\nand    the    Rock.    As    if    God    had    forgotten    how    evil    the    Babylonians    were,    Habakkuk    <br  \/>\r\ncalled    His    attention    to    their    wicked    behaviour,    in    verse    13.    They    were    too    cruel    and    <br  \/>\r\nruthless    in    their    war    tactics    against    other    nations.    The    prophet    further    described    <br  \/>\r\nthem    as    a    fisherman,    who    took    other    nations    captive    with    a    hook    and    net,    and    <br  \/>\r\nrejoiced     over     his     good     catch     (v.     15),     without     mercy.     Earlier     on,     the     prophet  compared    the    Babylonians    to    hunters    who    come    violently    against    their    prey    (v.    8).    <br  \/>\r\nThe     voice     of     an     angry     prophet     (Habakkuk)     concerning     Gods     continued    <br  \/>\r\nsilence    over    the    practice    of    injustice    is    seen    in    the    passage.    He    complained    and    <br  \/>\r\nreminded    God    that    He    is    too    holy    and    cannot    behold    evil    and    allow    it    to    thrive.    Thus    <br  \/>\r\nin     his     understanding,     it     was     improper     and     unjustifiable     for     God     to     use     such     a    <br  \/>\r\ntreacherous    nation    like    Babylon    to    reprimand    the    people    of    Judah,    when    they    ought    <br  \/>\r\nto    be    severely    punished    for    their    wickedness    against    other    nations.    After    all,    even    if    <br  \/>\r\nthere    are    wrongdoings    in    Judah    (Chapter    1:3),    surely    a    holy    and    eternal    God    knows    <br  \/>\r\nthat    His    people    are    more    righteous    than    those    who    are    attacking    them,    and    are    more    <br  \/>\r\nvaluable    than    fish    or    swarms    of    insects    v.    14.    The    comforting    thing    is    that,    despite    <br  \/>\r\nHabakkuks     displeasure     at     Gods     approach     to     disciplining     them     through     the    <br  \/>\r\nBabylonians,     he     had     absolute     trust     and     faith     in     the     God     of     his     salvation.     As     he    <br  \/>\r\nconsidered    again    the    unchangeable    character    of    God    as    eternal,    sovereign    and    holy,    <br  \/>\r\nhe    became    assured    that    Judah    would    not    be    completely    destroyed.    He    realised    that    <br  \/>\r\nthe    enemy    nation    would    only    be    used    as    an    instrument    to    bring    them    back    to    God,    <br  \/>\r\neven    though    he    did    not    understand    why    it    must    be    the    wicked    Babylon.    God    can    <br  \/>\r\nalways    use    the    ungodly    to    bring    about    godly    results    because    He    does    not    reason    like    <br  \/>\r\nhumankind    and    His    ways    are    completely    different    from    ours.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

He     M owned    many    companies,    houses    and    other    landed    properties.    He    was    <br  \/>\r\nrich     and     very     popular.

Therefore,     it     is     expected     that     any     person     saddled     with     such    <br \/>\r\nresponsibility     should     be     well-acquainted     with     the     required     laws     and    <br \/>\r\nstandards     without     prejudice,     as     they     relate     with     those     they     are     leading.

The    understanding    is    that    <br \/>\r\njustice    must    be    done    and    not    perverted.

Our    lesson    for    today    focuses    on    the    need    <br \/>\r\nfor    our    leaders    to    practise    justice    (and    not    pervert    it),    according    to    Gods    standard.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A.    God    Rebukes    Leaders    and    Prophets Micah    3:1-3<br \/>\r\nIn    the    days    of    Micah,    there    was    high    level    of    indiscipline,    injustice,    oppression    and    <br \/>\r\nexploitation.    Gods    message    to    them    was    for    both    the    civil    and    religious    leaders    (the    <br \/>\r\nprophets     and     priests)     who     oppressed     the     people     for     their     personal     gains.     He    <br \/>\r\naccused    them    for    the    decay    of    the    nation.    He    said    in    verses    1-2a,   Listen,    you    leaders    <br \/>\r\nof    Jacob,    you    rulers    of    the    house    of    Israel.    Should    you    not    know    justice,    you    who    hate    <br \/>\r\ngood    and    love    evil...? Because    he    was    not    impressed    by    the    activities    of    the    leaders,    <br \/>\r\nhe    compared    them    to    cannibals    who    cut    up    and    ate    the    peoples    flesh    and    bones   like    <br \/>\r\nmeat    for    the    pot    (vv.    1-4).    In    other    words,    the    people    whom    they    were    supposed    to    <br \/>\r\nlead    were    devoured    without    mercy    and    justice,    which    God    had    warned    them    against.    <br \/>\r\nInvariably,    they    had    no    concern    for    those    they    were    appointed    to    lead    and    serve.<br \/>\r\nMicahs    message    of    condemnation    was    to    the    ruling    class    in    Judah,    possibly    <br \/>\r\nunder    the    rule    of    Ahaz.    They    failed    in    their    responsibility    to    faithfully    administer    justice    and    carry    out    Gods    law    as    leaders.    They    used    their    power    only    for    unjust    <br \/>\r\ntreatment    and    exploitation    of    those    they    ought    to    protect.    Just    as    judgments    are    <br \/>\r\nrendered    in    the    law    court,    the    leaders    were    expected    to    apply    the    principles    of    <br \/>\r\nrighteousness    in    meeting    the    needs    of    the    people    but    they    were    only    guided    by    <br \/>\r\npersonal    considerations.    Therefore,    Micah    described    them    as    leaders    who    have    <br \/>\r\ntaken    up    arms    against    justice    and    conceived    a    bitter    hatred    for    what    is    appropriate    <br \/>\r\naccording    to    Gods    law.

They    are    corrupt;    they    perpetrate    evil,    pervert    justice    against    the    <br \/>\r\npoor,    shed    innocent    blood    and    sometimes    deny    people    their    rights    simply    because    <br \/>\r\nthey    do    not    have    the    fear    of    God.

In    fact,    he    was    emphatic    in    verses    9    and    10.    He    said,   Hear    this,    <br \/>\r\nyou    leaders    of    the    house    of    Jacob,    you    rulers    of    the    house    of    Israel,    who    despise    justice    <br \/>\r\nand     distort     all     that     is     right;     who     build     Zion     with     bloodshed     and     Jerusalem     with    <br \/>\r\nwickedness. Figuratively,    Micah    meant    that    the    city    of    Jerusalem    was    full    of    crime,    <br \/>\r\nmurder    and    injustice    (Habakkuk    2:12).    He    specifically    mentioned    the    sins    of    the    <br \/>\r\npeople    (v.    11):<br \/>\r\n\u00b7   The    citys    rulers    were    corrupt    in    the    discharge    of    their    duties;    they    governed    <br \/>\r\nfor    bribe,    which    is    detestable    to    God.<br \/>\r\n\u00b7   The    priests    interpreted    the    Law    for    a    pay.    Invariably,    those    who    could    not    <br \/>\r\nafford    their    high    charges    were    denied    access    to    the    Law.<br \/>\r\n\u00b7   The    prophets    gave    their    revelation    for    money.    Of    course,    this    is    one    of    the    <br \/>\r\ncharacteristics     of     false     prophets.     They     claim     to     speak     for     God     but     their    messages    are    always    influenced    by    what    they    get    and    are    contrary    to    the    will    <br \/>\r\nof    God    for    His    people.    Unfortunately,    they    believed    God    was    with    them    and    as    <br \/>\r\nsuch,    no    disaster    would    befall    them.    According    to    verse    12,    Micah    declared    <br \/>\r\nthat     Zion     would     be     plowed     like     a     field;     Jerusalem     will     become     a     heap     of    <br \/>\r\nrubble,    the    temple    hill    a    mound    overgrown    with    thickets.    <br \/>\r\nIt    is    obvious    that    Micah    was    no    longer    comfortable    with    the    ungodly    lifestyle    of    the    <br \/>\r\nrulers     of     Israel.     Sadly,     they     believed     that     the     Lord     was     with     them     and     with    <br \/>\r\nconfidence    they    say,   Is    not    the    Lord    among    us?    No    disaster    will    come    upon    us.

God's    Requirements    Emphasised Micah    6:6-8<br\/>\r\nThe    first    few    verses    of    chapter    6    clearly    state    God's    case    against    His    people    and    <br\/>\r\nsome    of    the    miracles    of    old.    According    to    verse    2    Micah    said,    'Hear,    O    mountains,    the    <br\/>\r\nLORD's    accusation;    listen,    you    everlasting    foundations    of    the    earth.    For    the    LORD    has    a    <br\/>\r\ncase    against    his    people;    he    is    lodging    a    charge    against    Israel.' God    expressed    His    <br\/>\r\ndispleasure    that    His    people    have    broken    His    covenant    and    forgotten    His    laws.    The    <br\/>\r\n__ question    in    verse    6    is    rhetorical      it    is    about    what    should    be    brought    to    God    during    <br\/>\r\nworship;    whether    to    bow    down,    burnt    offerings    or    with    a-year-old    calves.    Will    God    <br\/>\r\nbe    pleased    with    the    offerings    of    ten    thousand    rams,    rivers    of    oil    or    the    sacrifice    of    <br\/>\r\nfirstborn    son    for    the    sin    of    the    soul?    Micah    did    not    deny    the    importance    of    sacrifices    <br\/>\r\nto    God    but    according    to    him,    obedience    is    preferred    to    the    rituals    (1    Samuel    1:11-<br\/>\r\n15).     By     implication,     Micah     meant     that     obedience,     true     repentance     and     self-<br\/>\r\nsurrender    cannot    be    exchanged    with    extravagant    gifts    and    sacrifices    to    the    Lord.    <br\/>\r\nAfter    all,    God's    requirement    is    for    His    people    to    act    justly,    love    mercy    and    walk    <br\/>\r\nhumbly    with    Him    (v.    8),    without    which    our    offerings    will    not    be    acceptable    to    God.<br\/>\r\nIt    is    obvious    from    the    passage    that    the    people    of    Israel    did    not    know    that    God    <br\/>\r\nwas     more     interested     in     their     willingness     to     obey     Him     than     their     fat     sacrifices.    <br\/>\r\nPerhaps     they     thought     they     could     obtain     God's     mercy     and     favour     with     their    extravagant    sacrifices.    God's    demand    for    His    people    has    not    changed.    He    requires    a    <br\/>\r\ntrue    and    living    faith,    which    manifests    through    obedience,    justice,    love,    mercy    and    to    <br\/>\r\nhumbly    walk    with    Him    in    accordance    with    the    principles    of    the    Scripture.

Highlights    of    the    event    included    testimonies    from    <br\/>\r\nmembers    of    the    church    regarding    the    faithfulness    of    God,    especially    since    the    pastor    <br\/>\r\nassumed    the    pastorate    of    the    church.    In    his    closing    remarks,    the    pastor,    who    was    full    <br\/>\r\nof    excitement,    thanked    the    members    for    their    resilience,    spirit    of    teamwork    and    <br\/>\r\ntheir     sacrificial     giving     throughout     the     period     of     building.

Finally,    <br\/>\r\nhe    stood    at    the    altar    and    blessed    the    people    and    encouraged    them    to    do    more    for    the    <br\/>\r\nLord    in    the    New    Year.

The    Servant    and    His    Mission    Stated     Isaiah    42:1-4<br  \/>\r\nChapter     42     of     the     book     of     Isaiah     is     known     as     The     Servant     Song.     Although     no    <br  \/>\r\nspecific     name     was     mentioned     as     the     servant     throughout     the     passage,     the    <br  \/>\r\ndescriptions    fit    the    person    of    Jesus    and    the    nature    of    His    earthly    ministry    as    a    just    <br  \/>\r\nservant.    According    to    verse    1,    God    spoke    through    Isaiah    saying,    Here    is    my    servant,    <br  \/>\r\nwhom    I    uphold,    my    chosen    one    in    whom    I    delight;    I    will    put    my    Spirit    on    him    and    he    will    <br  \/>\r\nbring    justice    to    the    nations.    (v.    1)    The    mission    of    the    servant    is    well-stated,    from    <br  \/>\r\nverse    2.    He    says:<br  \/>\r\n\u00b7    He    would    be    a    gentle    and    humble    servant    who    will    not    shout    or    cry    out;<br  \/>\r\n\u00b7    He    will    save    and    not    destroy    those    who    are    treading    towards    destruction;<br  \/>\r\n\u00b7    He    will    bring    lasting    justice    to    all;<br  \/>\r\n\u00b7    He    will    not    lose    hope    or    courage    until    He    establishes    justice    on    the    earth;<br  \/>\r\n\u00b7    In    his    teaching,    the    islands    will    put    their    hope.<br  \/>\r\nFrom    the    passage,    it    is    apparent    that    Jesus    is    the    servant    who    is    described    as    the    <br  \/>\r\nChosen    and    Elect    of    God    (v.    1a).    He    was    chosen    by    God    with    an    elaborate    mission    of    <br  \/>\r\ndivine    justice    and    delight,    which    He    would    bring    about    to    the    nations    (v.    2).    The    mission    was    to    be    accomplished    in    quietness.    He    is    also    depicted    as    courageous    and    <br  \/>\r\nresolute    until    He    accomplishes    His    mission    (v.    4).    The    fulfilment    of    these    attributes    <br  \/>\r\nare    found    in    Christ    (Matthew    12:15-21).    He    came    for    the    salvation    of    humankind    <br  \/>\r\nand    sought    for    the    lost    (Matthew    18:11;    20:28).    He    demonstrated    impartiality    in    <br  \/>\r\nHis    dealings    with    people    and    faithfully    accomplished    the    work    of    salvation    on    the    <br  \/>\r\ncross    of    Calvary,    in    spite    of    the    shame    (Hebrews    12:2).    Although    it    seems    justice    is    <br  \/>\r\ngradually    eroding    from    the    society,    Christians    should    be    reminded    that    they    have    <br  \/>\r\nbeen    called    to    live    righteously    and    shine    like    light    in    this    dark    world.    <\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

Precisely    in    verse    6,    God    promised    to    give    the    servant    power    to    <br  \/>\r\nexecute    justice    on    earth    by    virtue    of    his    call.

The     promise     of     new     things     God     made     known     in     verse     9     is     the    <br  \/>\r\nrestoration    of    the    nation    of    Israel.<br  \/>\r\nNo    other    person    was    more    qualified    to    be    referred    to    as    the    servant    than    Jesus    <br  \/>\r\nChrist.    Reading    from    the    book    of    Isaiah,    Jesus    revealed    His    mission,    which    is    the    <br  \/>\r\nperfect    confirmation    of    the    duties    assigned    to    the    servant    in    our    passage    (Isaiah    <br  \/>\r\n61:1-2;     Luke     4:17-19).     Primarily,     Jesus     came     to     set     humankind     free     from     the    <br  \/>\r\nbondage    of    sin.    Therefore,    He    is    both    the    Saviour    and    the    Judge    of    the    world.

The    people    were    moved    as    they    sang    praises    to    God    for    the    miracle.    Few    <br\/>\r\nweeks    after    the    crusade,    the    testimony    was    being    discussed    almost    everywhere    in    <br\/>\r\nthe    city.    One    day,    a    Muslim    brother    who    heard    about    the    miracle    attempted    to    refute    <br\/>\r\nit.    He    said    the    man    was    not    dead    but    had    fainted    with    the    claim    that    whoever    dies    <br\/>\r\ncannot    be    raised    back    to    life    again    by    anyone.    He    lacked    the    understanding    that    God    <br\/>\r\nhas    power    to    do    everything.<br\/>\r\nThe    mystery    of    resurrection    cannot    be    comprehended    by    human    reasoning.

The    misconception    of    the    Muslim    brother,    in    the    story    above,    can    be    <br\/>\r\nlikened    to    the    brethren    in    Corinth,    in    our    lesson    today.    They    probably    doubted    the    <br\/>\r\nresurrection    of    Jesus    with    the    assumption    that    such    has    never    happened    in    the    <br\/>\r\nhistory    of    humankind.    But    beyond    the    resurrection    of    Jesus,    Paul    was    able    to    prove    <br\/>\r\nto    them    beyond    doubt,    the    resurrection    of    believers    in    Christ.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A.    Proof    of    Jesus'    Resurrection     1    Corinthians    15:1-8<br\/>\r\nApostle    Paul's    letter    to    the    Corinthian    church    was    a    reminder    of    the    Gospel    he    had    <br\/>\r\npreached    to    them,    which    they    received    with    faith    (v.    1).    The    Greeks,    among    whom    <br\/>\r\nwere    the    Corinthians,    do    not    believe    in    the    resurrection    of    the    dead.    During    one    of    <br\/>\r\nPaul's    teachings    among    the    Greeks,    he    stressed    the    reality    of    the    resurrection    of    the    <br\/>\r\ndead.     The     assertion     was     met     with     mixed     feelings     from     the     people.     While     some    <br\/>\r\ndisbelieved,    like    the    Muslim    who    did    not    believe    the    miracle    of    raising    the    dead,    <br\/>\r\nothers     embraced     the     teaching     (Acts     17:32).     In     his     response,     Paul     wrote     to     the    <br\/>\r\nCorinthians     to     intimate     them     of     the     certainty     of     the     resurrection     of     those     who    <br\/>\r\nbelieve    in    Christ.    He    reiterated    the    reality    of    the    resurrection    of    Jesus    Christ    with    <br\/>\r\nevidence     of     His     appearances.     According     to     Paul,     beginning     from     verse     5,     Jesus    <br\/>\r\nappeared    to    several    people    after    His    resurrection.    For    instance,    He    appeared    to    <br\/>\r\nCephas    (Peter),    the    Twelve,    over    five    hundred    brethren;    most    of    who    were    still    <br\/>\r\nliving.    He    also    appeared    to    James,    all    the    apostles    and    himself    (Paul).    <br\/>\r\nJesus'    resurrection    is    indeed    a    sign    of    hope    for    justice.    He    appeared    to    different    <br\/>\r\npeople,    which    confirms    the    reality    of    His    resurrection.    Thus    Paul    referred    to    them    including    himself    as    witnesses    of    the    resurrection    story.    The    resurrection    of    Jesus    <br\/>\r\nChrist    is    not    a    folktale.    The    Scripture    confirms    that    He    truly    resurrected    as    He    had    <br\/>\r\npredicted.    His    early    followers    witnessed    and    proclaimed    His    resurrection.

Just    as    death    came    <br\/>\r\nthrough    Adam,    Jesus    becomes    the    originator    of    life    eternal    for    those    who    believe    in    <br\/>\r\nHim.    At    the    end    of    age,    believers    in    Christ    will    be    raised    to    life    eternal    with    God    in    His    <br\/>\r\nkingdom.<br\/>\r\nThe     hope     of     resurrection     for     believers     is     already     secured     through     the    <br\/>\r\nresurrection    of    Jesus.    Even    though    believers    will    experience    physical    death    and    <br\/>\r\ntransit     into     glory     where     they     will     reign     with     Christ     forever,     there     is     hope     of    <br\/>\r\nresurrection.     Christ     achieved     this     through     His     death     and     has     made     His     own    <br\/>\r\nresurrection    an    evidence    of    resurrection    of    all    believers    at    the    end    of    age.    Believers    <br\/>\r\nshould    appropriate    this    by    having    faith    in    Him    and    His    resurrection    and    should    not    <br\/>\r\nbelieve    any    contrary    view    to    the    resurrection    of    believers.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

The    Promise    of    a    Transformed    Body 1    Corinthians    15:42-45<br\/>\r\nIn     Corinth,     some     denied     the     reality     of     the     resurrection     of     believers     with     the    <br\/>\r\nassumption    that    physical    bodies    cannot    be    raised    back    to    life.    They    would    have    <br\/>\r\nconsidered    the    fact    that    at    death,    human    body    decomposes.    But    Apostle    Paul    argued    <br\/>\r\nthat     the     risen     body     will     be     a     spiritual     body     and     not     a     physical     body     that     is    <br\/>\r\nperishable.

Apostle     Paul     further     explains     that     during    <br\/>\r\nresurrection,    the    body    will    be    transformed    from    perishable    to    imperishable;    from    <br\/>\r\ndishonoured    to    glorified    body;    from    weak    to    powerful    body;    and    from    natural    body    <br\/>\r\nto    spiritual    body    (vv.    43-44).

The     book     of     Esther     has     no     mention     of     God     but     it    <br  \/>\r\nportrays    the    miraculous    deliverance    of    the    people    of    God    through    the    gracious    <br  \/>\r\nintervention    of    God,    using    Esther    as    an    instrument.    Esther,    though    initially    was    <br  \/>\r\nfearful    of    her    life,    later    endangered    her    life    and    became    the    instrument    God    used    to    <br  \/>\r\nfight    the    injustice    against    the    Jews.    <\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A.    A    Royal    Permit     Esther    7:1-2<br  \/>\r\nHaman    plotted    to    destroy    all    the    Jews    in    Susa    because    Mordecai    refused    to    bow    to    <br  \/>\r\nhonour    him    like    the    other    royal    officials    (Esther    3:2,    6).    When    Mordecai    heard    of    the    <br  \/>\r\nevil    plan,    he    sought    for    Esthers    intervention,    and    she    was    willing    to    do    everything    <br  \/>\r\npossible    to    save    her    people    from    total    destruction.    Having    prayed,    twice    Esther    <br  \/>\r\ninvited    the    king    and    Haman    to    a    banquet    in    her    house    (Esther    5:1-7;    7:1).    The    <br  \/>\r\npurpose    of    this    invitation    was    to    make    her    petition    known    to    the    king    so    that    the    <br  \/>\r\nverdict    to    wipe    out    the    nation    of    Israel    would    be    averted.    So    the    king    and    Haman    <br  \/>\r\nwent    to    Esther    to    eat    with    her    the    second    time.    Eventually,    Esther    found    favour    in    <br  \/>\r\nthe    sight    of    the    king.    During    each    of    the    banquet,    the    king    granted    Esther    a    royal    <br  \/>\r\npermit    to    request    whatever    she    wanted    (Esther    5:6;    7:2).    He    said    to    Esther,    Queen    <br  \/>\r\nEsther,    what    is    your    petition?    It    will    be    given    you.    What    is    your    request?    Even    up    to    half    <br  \/>\r\nthe    kingdom,    it    will    be    granted.

It    was    a    royal    request    and    divine    intervention    <br  \/>\r\nbecause    ordinarily,    no    one    appears    before    the    king    without    being    invited.    It    was    a    <br  \/>\r\nserious    offence    with    death    penalty    (Esther    4:11).    Although    she    was    initially    afraid,    <br  \/>\r\nEsther    and    her    people    prayed    and    fasted    for    favour    in    the    sight    of    the    king    and    their    <br  \/>\r\nprayer    was    answered.

He    was    precise    in    verse    8    about    His    love    for    <br  \/>\r\njustice.     He     said,     For     I,     the     Lord,     love     justice;     I     hate     robbery     and     iniquity.

In    other    <br  \/>\r\nwords,    even    though    Israel    had    been    robbed    and    oppressed,    in    His    faithfulness,    He    will    <br  \/>\r\nreward    (restore)    them    and    enter    into    an    eternal    covenant    relationship    with    them.    <br  \/>\r\nFrom    then    on,    their    descendants    will    be    famous    among    the    nations    and    everyone    <br  \/>\r\nwho    sees    them    will    know    that    they    are    a    people    whom    God    has    blessed.    Beginning    <br  \/>\r\nfrom    verse    9,    Isaiah    began    to    rejoice    over    Jerusalem    because    of    what    God    has    done.    <br  \/>\r\nFirst,    she    is    likened    to    a    bride    dressed    for    her    wedding    and    whom    God    has    clothed    <br  \/>\r\nwith    salvation    and    victory.    To    confirm    these    promises,    he    added    that    as    the    soil    makes    <br  \/>\r\nthe    sprout    to    come    up    and    a    garden    causes    seeds    to    grow,    so    the    sovereign    Lord    will    <br  \/>\r\nmake    righteousness    (justice)    and    praise    spring    up    before    all    nations    (vv.    10-11).    <br  \/>\r\nGods    promise    to    restore    His    people    was    as    a    result    of    His    love    for    justice    as    it    is    <br  \/>\r\nindicated    in    the    passage.    Although    some    people    are    tempted    to    believe    that    God    does    <br  \/>\r\nnot    care    about    giving    justice    because    the    righteous    and    the    poor    sometimes    suffer    and    are    oppressed,    God    loves    justice.    Believers    may    sometimes    suffer    injustice    but    <br  \/>\r\nthey    will    surely    be    vindicated    at    Gods    own    time    and    things    will    turn    around    for    <br  \/>\r\ntheir    good.    God    clearly    stated    in    verse    8    that    He    loves    justice,    hates    robbery    and    <br  \/>\r\niniquity    but    in    His    faithfulness,    He    promised    to    reward    and    make    an    everlasting    <br  \/>\r\ncovenant    with    them.    This    means    that    God    wants    believers    in    Christ    to    make    justice    <br  \/>\r\nprevail     through     righteousness     in     our     workplaces,     community,     church     and    <br  \/>\r\neverywhere    we    go.

Some    leaders     derive     pleasure     in     cheating     and     oppressing     others,     especially     the    <br\/>\r\nunderprivileged    for    their    selfish    interest.    Sometimes,    they    humiliate    and    <br\/>\r\nintentionally    deny    others    their    rights    because    of    the    position    they    occupy.    They    <br\/>\r\nmake     life     difficult     for     their     subjects,     subordinates     or     the     less     privileged     when    <br\/>\r\nactually    they    are    supposed    to    make    positive    impacts    in    their    lives.    It    happens    in    all    <br\/>\r\n__ levels     of     government        local,     state     and     federal     and     even     in     some     Christian    <br\/>\r\norganisations.    Such    evil    practices    were    common    among    the    leaders    of    Judah    and    <br\/>\r\nJerusalem.     They     were     disobedient,     idolatrous,     corrupt,     wicked     and     oppressive    <br\/>\r\nwithout    the    consciousness    of    an    impending    doom,    despite    God's    several    warnings    <br\/>\r\nthrough    the    prophets.    <br\/>\r\nZephaniah    was    one    of    the    prophets    who    prophesied    the    destruction    of    Judah.    <br\/>\r\nHis    main    theme    was    the    day    of    the    Lord    in    Judah    and    other    nations    when    God's    <br\/>\r\npunishment    will    be    upon    them.    Today's    lesson    centres    on    the    vision    of    restoration    <br\/>\r\nthrough    Prophet    Zephaniah    to    the    oppressed    in    Israel.    According    to    the    vision,    <br\/>\r\neven    though    they    have    been    cheated    and    oppressed    by    their    leaders,    God    promised    <br\/>\r\nto    restore    them    and    judge    their    wicked    oppressors.    Apart    from    this    message    of    <br\/>\r\npromise    to    restore    Israel    there    are    other    similar    instances    of    God's    promise    to    His    <br\/>\r\npeople    e.g.    God's    promise    of    restoration    to    Israel    through    Prophet    Isaiah,    Jeremiah    <br\/>\r\nand    Hosea    (Isaiah    49:8-13;    52:1-5;    Jeremiah    30:1-3,    17-20;    Hosea    14:4-7).<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A.    God's    Promise    of    Restoration Zephaniah    3:14-16<br\/>\r\nThe    city    of    Jerusalem    was    known    for    her    wickedness,    disobedience    to    God's    laws,    <br\/>\r\noppression,    rebellion,    violence,    unrighteousness    and    injustice.    Her    prophets    and    <br\/>\r\n__ leaders     were     corrupt       they     forsook     God     and     embraced     worldly     lifestyle.     The    <br\/>\r\npriests    profaned    the    sanctuary    and    the    law    of    God.    Unfortunately,    the    rot    soon    <br\/>\r\nspread     into     every     sector     of     the     society.     Consequently,     God     was     provoked     and    <br\/>\r\ndecided    to    wipe    away    the    city    and    its    inhabitants.    He    said    to    them,    'Therefore    wait    <br\/>\r\nfor    me,'    declares    the    LORD,    'for    the    day    I    will    stand    up    to    testify.    I    have    decided    to    <br\/>\r\n__ assemble    the    nations,    to    gather    the    kingdoms    and    to    pour    out    my    wrath    on    them      all    <br\/>\r\nmy    fierce    anger.    The    whole    world    will    be    consumed    by    the    fire    of    my    jealous    anger.' (v.    <br\/>\r\n8)    The    warning    was    followed    by    a    promise    to    bring    about    justice    and    restore    the    <br\/>\r\nremnants     of     Israel     so     that     no     one     will     make     them     afraid     again.     Israel     was    <br\/>\r\nencouraged    to    sing    aloud,    be    glad    and    rejoice    with    all    their    hearts    because    the    LORD    has    brought    an    end    to    their    punishment    and    injustice    in    the    land.    Moreover,    <br\/>\r\nHe    has    defeated    all    their    enemies;    therefore,    they    have    no    reason    to    be    afraid.    The    <br\/>\r\nwords    'Do    not    be    afraid',    as    used    in    the    passage    implies    God's    presence    to    save    His    <br\/>\r\npeople.        One    of    the    characteristics    of    God    is    compassion    as    revealed    in    verses    14-15.    <br\/>\r\nHe    told    the    children    of    Israel    to    rejoice    and    sing    because    the    Lord    has    taken    away    <br\/>\r\ntheir    punishment    and    cast    out    their    enemies.    He    also    assured    them    of    His    presence,    <br\/>\r\njustice    and    safety,    which    certainly    are    the    result    of    the    promise    of    restoration.    When    <br\/>\r\nGod    forgives,    takes    away    our    punishment    and    shields    us    with    His    presence,    the    best    <br\/>\r\nresponse     is     to     sing     songs     of     praise     with     the     resolution     to     keep     His     laws     and    <br\/>\r\ncommands.    Christians    are,    therefore,    encouraged    to    rejoice    in    the    Lord    always,    <br\/>\r\nespecially    when    He    shows    us    mercy,    justice    and    love    instead    of    punishment    and    <br\/>\r\ndestruction.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

God's    Promise    of    Victory    for    Jerusalem Zephaniah    3:16-17<br\/>\r\nZephaniah's    vision    of    restoration    for    Jerusalem    was    all-inclusive.    He    encouraged    <br\/>\r\nthe    people    of    Israel    to    sing    and    shout    for    joy    because    of    God's    promise    to    bring    <br\/>\r\nabout    justice,    end    their    punishment    and    cast    out    their    enemies.    He    also    prophesied    <br\/>\r\nconcerning    their    future.    He    assured    them    of    God's    presence    and    His    love    for    them.    <br\/>\r\nHe    said    in    verses    16    and    17,    'On    that    day    they    will    say    to    Jerusalem,    'Do    not    fear,    O    <br\/>\r\nZion;    do    not    let    your    hands    hang    limp.    The    LORD    your    God    is    with    you,    he    is    mighty    to    <br\/>\r\nsave    ....' He    added    that    God    will    take    delight    in    them,    give    them    new    life    and    rejoice    <br\/>\r\nover    them    with    songs    of    joy.    As    a    result,    the    people    of    Jerusalem    had    no    cause    to    fear    <br\/>\r\nor    be    discouraged    any    longer    because    God    has    promised    to    save    and    give    them    <br\/>\r\nvictory    over    their    enemies    (v.    16).    <br\/>\r\nThe    vision    of    Zephaniah    was    an    encouragement    to    the    people    of    Israel    not    to    <br\/>\r\ngive    up    but    to    trust    in    the    Lord    for    victory.    The    admonition    'not    to    fear'    became    <br\/>\r\nnecessary    because    of    its    consequences    like:    fear    defeat,    doubt,    and    the    temptation    <br\/>\r\nto    compromise    their    faith,    especially    in    the    face    of    threat    or    suffering.    When    we    <br\/>\r\ntrust    in    God    who    has    promised    victory    for    His    people,    we    will    surely    triumph    over    our    enemies.    Interestingly,    faith,    obedience,    trust    in    God,    righteousness    and    hope    <br\/>\r\nfor    a    better    future    are    some    ways    to    overcome    oppression    and    poverty.    The    promise    <br\/>\r\nof    victory    for    the    Israelites    is    also    applicable    to    contemporary    Christians,    especially    <br\/>\r\nthese    days    when    there    is    severe    persecution    of    believers.    Today's    lesson    should    <br\/>\r\nserve    as    encouragement    not    to    entertain    any    fear    from    the    enemy;    rather    we    should    <br\/>\r\nbuild    our    faith    in    God    who    has    promised    us    justice,    salvation    and    victory.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

Divine    Restoration    after    Loss Zephaniah    3:18-20<br\/>\r\nThe    last    aspect    of    Zephaniah's    prophecies    was    a    declaration    of    God's    promise    of    His    <br\/>\r\njudgment     on     the     oppressors     and     divine     restoration     for     His     people.     First,     God    <br\/>\r\npromised     to     remove     from     His     people     those     who     mourn     over     the     loss     of     their    <br\/>\r\nappointed    festivals,    which    was    a    burden    and    reproach    to    them    (v.    18).    In    verse    19,    <br\/>\r\nGod    promised    to    deal    with    all    those    who    afflict    them.    For    instance,    He    promised    to:<br\/>\r\n\u00b7  Punish    their    oppressors    and    rescue    the    lame    from    their    captivity;<br\/>\r\n\u00b7  Assemble    those    in    captivity,    those    who    yearned    and    grieved    for    the    solemn    <br\/>\r\nassembly    and    the    festival    of    God;<br\/>\r\n\u00b7  Give    His    people    praise    and    honour    where    they    have    been    disgraced;    <br\/>\r\n\u00b7  Bring    them    back    from    exile    to    their    own    land    and    restore    their    fortunes;<br\/>\r\n\u00b7  Make    them    famous    throughout    the    world    and    make    them    prosperous    again.<br\/>\r\nGod    is    a    covenant-keeping    God.    The    promise    of    divine    restoration    of    His    people    <br\/>\r\nfrom    exile    to    their    own    land,    and    to    give    honour    in    place    of    shame    were    all    fulfilled.    <br\/>\r\nProbably,    the    psalmist    was    inspired    by    this,    thus    he    said,    'When    the    LORD    brought    <br\/>\r\nback    the    captives    to    Zion,    we    were    like    men    who    dreamed.'    (Psalm    126:1).    Though    it    <br\/>\r\nseems    difficult    to    believe    that    there    will    be    restoration    after    great    loss,    but    the    <br\/>\r\nencouragement    in    today's    lesson    is    that    God's    promise    is    dependable    and    with    Him,    <br\/>\r\nrestoration    is    sure.

Message    of    Hope    for    Israel Zechariah    8:1-8<br\/>\r\nOne    major    problem    of    the    people    of    Israel    was    inconsistency    in    their    relationship    <br\/>\r\nwith     God.     They     continually     sinned     and     rebelled     against     God,     despite     His    <br\/>\r\nfaithfulness    to    them    right    from    the    time    they    left    Egypt.    After    several    warnings,    <br\/>\r\nGod's    anger    burned    against    them.    Eventually,    they    were    led    into    exile    in    Babylon    <br\/>\r\nwhere    they    were    punished.    God    had    spoken    through    prophets    like    Hosea,    Haggai    <br\/>\r\nand    others    in    the    past    but    He    decided    to    send    words    of    hope    and    encouragement    to    <br\/>\r\nJudah    through    Prophet    Zechariah.    In    particular,    Zechariah's    assignment    was    to    call    <br\/>\r\nthe    people    to    return    to    God    so    that    He    would    return    to    them,    even    though    He    was    <br\/>\r\nonce    angry    with    their    forefathers    because    they    broke    the    covenant    He    made    with    <br\/>\r\nthem.     According     to     verse     4,     God     warned     that     they     should     not     be     like     their    <br\/>\r\nforefathers    who    did    not    listen    or    pay    attention    to    His    admonition    to    turn    from    their    <br\/>\r\nevil     practices,     despite     the     effort     of     the     earlier     prophets.     Unfortunately,     their    <br\/>\r\nancestors    and    the    prophets    were    no    longer    alive    because    they    disregarded    God's    <br\/>\r\nlaws    and    decrees.    Their    children    suffered    the    consequences    of    their    disobedience    <br\/>\r\nand    eventually    repented.    Their    confession    is    expressed    thus:    'The    Lord    Almighty    <br\/>\r\nhas    done    for    us    what    our    ways    and    practices    deserve,    just    as    he    determined    to    do.' The    people    acknowledged    that    their    punishment    was    as    a    result    of    their    disobedience.    <br\/>\r\nHowever,    the    Lord    gave    Zechariah    a    message    for    the    people    in    the    second    year    that    <br\/>\r\nDarius    was    emperor.    God's    message    came    as    a    vision    to    Zechariah.    He    saw    a    man    <br\/>\r\nriding    a    red    horse!    Standing    among    the    myrtle    trees    in    a    valley,    and    behind    him    <br\/>\r\nwere    other    horses    like    red,    dappled,    and    white    (v.    8).<br\/>\r\nIt    is    apparent    that    God    had    a    purpose    and    plan    for    His    people    to    gather    them    <br\/>\r\nfrom    all    the    countries    they    were    scattered.    However,    verses    2-6    are    a    recap    of    past    <br\/>\r\nhistory    with    a    stern    warning,    so    that    the    present    generation    will    not    emulate    their    <br\/>\r\nforefathers     who     continually     rebelled     against     God.     The     vision     of     horsemen     that    <br\/>\r\npatrolled    the    world    on    behalf    of    God    was    a    message    of    comfort    and    encouragement    <br\/>\r\nfor    God's    people    that    Jerusalem    will    be    rebuilt    and    prosperity    will    be    restored.    No    <br\/>\r\nmatter    how    terrible    our    sins    may    be,    God    still    loves    us    and    wants    to    bring    us    back    to    <br\/>\r\nHimself.     Though     the     punishment     for     such     sin     may     not     be     reversed     but     His    <br\/>\r\nfaithfulness    endures    forever.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

Divine    Blessings    for    Israel `     Zechariah    <br\/>\r\n8:11-13<br\/>\r\nGod's    love    for    Israel    is    unparalleled.    Part    of    His    message    through    Prophet    Zechariah    <br\/>\r\nto    them    was    the    encouragement    to    be    strong    because    peace    and    justice    would    reign    <br\/>\r\nand    the    temple    would    be    rebuilt    (v.    9).    Before    the    foundation    of    the    temple    was    laid,    <br\/>\r\nthere    were    no    wage    for    people    or    animals    and    there    was    no    security.    No    one    was    <br\/>\r\n__ safe     from     his     enemies     because     people     had     turned     against     one     another       the    <br\/>\r\nconsequence    of    their    disobedience    to    God.    But    according    to    verse    11,    God    promised    <br\/>\r\nto     reverse     the     situation     of     the     remnants     of     Israel.     Instead     of     fear,     injustice,    <br\/>\r\ninsecurity    and    famine,    it    would    be    divine    blessings.

In     the     past     before     God's     intervention,     there     was     no     peace,    <br\/>\r\nsecurity    and    economic    stability,    but    as    the    remnants    repent    and    turn    to    God,    He    <br\/>\r\nwould    look    upon    them    with    compassion.    There    would    be    economic    stability    as    <br\/>\r\ntheir     seeds     would     grow     well,     their     vines     would     yield     fruits,     the     ground     would    <br\/>\r\nproduce    its    crops    and    heaven    would    give    rain.    Instead    of    curses,    God    promised    to    <br\/>\r\nbless    and    make    them    a    source    of    blessings    to    the    people    around    them.    They    would    <br\/>\r\nenjoy    peace,    safety,    justice    and    salvation.    Simply    put,    God's    intended    disaster    on    them     would     be     reserved     unlike     their     ancestors     who     incurred     the     wrath     of     God    <br\/>\r\nbecause    of    their    constant    rebellion.    Peace    and    justice    as    they    are    used    in    the    passage    <br\/>\r\nmeans    a    life    free    of    troubles,    injustice,    dishonesty    and    oppression.

God's    Expectation    from    Israel Zechariah    8:14-17<br\/>\r\nZechariah's    vision    was    not    immediately    clear    to    him.    The    man    who    stood    among    the    <br\/>\r\nmyrtle     trees     explained     that     the     horses     are     God's     representatives     who     travel    <br\/>\r\nthroughout    the    earth    (vv.    9-10).    They    reported    to    the    angel    and    said,    'We    have    gone    <br\/>\r\nthroughout    the    earth    and    found    the    whole    world    at    rest    and    peace.'    (v.    11)    Then    the    <br\/>\r\nangel    asked,    'LORD    Almighty,    how    long    will    you    withhold    mercy    from    Jerusalem    and    <br\/>\r\nfrom    the    towns    of    Judah,    which    you    have    been    angry    with    these    seventy    years?' God's    <br\/>\r\nresponse    to    the    angel    was    kind    and    comforting.    He    said,    'Just    as    I    had    determined    to    <br\/>\r\nbring    disaster    upon    you    and    showed    no    pity    when    your    forefathers    angered    me,    so    I    <br\/>\r\nhave    determined    to    do    good    again    to    Jerusalem    and    Judah.    Do    not    be    afraid.' (vv.    14-<br\/>\r\n15)    According    to    verse    16,    God    specified    His    expectations    from    the    people:    <br\/>\r\n\u00b7     They    are    to    speak    the    truth    to    one    another.<br\/>\r\n\u00b7     Give    true    and    sound    judgment    in    their    courts    to    bring    peace.    <br\/>\r\n\u00b7     They    should    not    plan    any    evil    or    bear    false    witness    against    their    neighbours.<br\/>\r\n\u00b7     They    must    love    and    promote    peace.

As    it    was    the    tradition    of    the    villagers    since    the    <br\/>\r\ntime     of     their     forefathers,     it     was     mandatory     for     the     villagers     to     serve     as    <br\/>\r\nlabourers    in    the    king's    farm    without    wages    or    compensation    of    any    kind.    Anyone    <br\/>\r\nwho    revolted    was    made    to    face    severe    punishment.    Worse    still,    the    people    had    no    <br\/>\r\nchoice    but    to    obey    the    commands    of    the    king,    whether    or    not    it    was    convenient.    The    <br\/>\r\nland    was    characterised    by    wickedness,    oppression,    injustice    and    all    kinds    of    evil,    <br\/>\r\nand     nobody     dared     challenge     the     king     about     his     activities.     The     people     were    <br\/>\r\nenslaved,    maltreated    and    denied    rest    and    justice.    This    went    on    for    a    long    time    until    <br\/>\r\nGod     sent     a     young     evangelist     from     the     neighbouring     village     to     the     people.     He    <br\/>\r\nwitnessed    Christ    to    the    villagers    and    many    of    them    accepted    Him    as    their    Saviour    <br\/>\r\nand    Lord.    The    young    man    led    them    to    pray    for    God's    intervention    concerning    the    <br\/>\r\nsituation    of    their    land.    God    answered    their    prayers    and    delivered    them    from    the    <br\/>\r\nhands    of    the    king.    The    death    of    the    king    brought    an    end    to    the    oppression    of    the    <br\/>\r\npeople.<br\/>\r\nToday's     lesson     centres     on     Jeremiah     who     declared     the     mind     of     God     to     the    <br\/>\r\npeople     of     Jerusalem     to     execute     justice     and     deliver     the     oppressed     from     their    <br\/>\r\noppressors.     Prophet     Jeremiah     was     one     of     the     prophets     called     by     God     to     speak    <br\/>\r\nagainst    the    sins    of    the    people    of    his    time,    especially    the    king    and    his    officials    who    <br\/>\r\nindulged     in     injustice     and     wickedness.     King     Zedekiah     was     frightened     at     the    <br\/>\r\napproach    of    the    Babylonian    army    and    then    appealed    to    Jeremiah    to    intercede    on    <br\/>\r\ntheir     behalf     to     God.     Jeremiah     only     advised     Zedekiah     to     yield     the     city     to     the    <br\/>\r\nBabylonians    and    make    them    to    know    the    impending    punishment    from    God    if    they    <br\/>\r\nfail    to    repent    and    turn    to    Him    in    all    sincerity.    <\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A.    Opportunity    to    Make    a    Choice Jeremiah    21:8-9<br\/>\r\nIn    the    days    of    King    Zedekiah    and    his    officials,    evil    and    injustice    reigned    supreme.    <br\/>\r\nThe    people    disregarded    God's    instruction    through    Prophet    Jeremiah.    When    Pashur    <br\/>\r\n(whose    duty    was    to    maintain    order    in    the    temple    area)    heard    the    prophecy    against    <br\/>\r\nJerusalem     and     Judah,     he     had     Jeremiah     beaten.     He     put     him     in     chains     with     the    <br\/>\r\naccusation     of     giving     false     prophecy     against     them     (Jeremiah     20:1-6).     However,    <br\/>\r\nwhen  it  was  prophesied  that  Jerusalem  would  be  defeated  by  King<br\/>\r\nNebuchadnezzar    and    his    army,    Zedekiah    felt    threatened.    He    sent    Pashur    and    Priest    <br\/>\r\nZephaniah    to    Jeremiah    to    make    inquiry    whether    God    would    fight    for    them    as    in    time    <br\/>\r\npast    when    an    angel    killed    185,000    Assyrian    soldiers    and    Sennacherib    withdrew    <br\/>\r\nfrom    his    attack    on    the    people    (2    Kings    19:32-36).    God    promised    to    fight    against    <br\/>\r\nZedekiah     and     hand     him     over     to     King     Nebuchadnezzar,     the     king     of     Babylon,    <br\/>\r\nalongside    his    officials    without    mercy    (vv.    3-7).    Nevertheless,    God    gave    opportunity    to    the    people    to    make    their    choices    through    the    words    of    Prophet    Jeremiah.    He    said,    <br\/>\r\n'See,    I    am    setting    before    you    the    way    of    life    and    the    way    of    death.    Whoever    stays    in    this    <br\/>\r\ncity    will    die    by    the    sword,    famine    or    plague,    but    whoever    goes    out    and    surrender    to    <br\/>\r\nthe    Babylonians    who    are    besieging    you    will    live;    he    will    escape    with    his    life.' (vv.    8-9)    <br\/>\r\nGod    was    determined    to    fight    against    Zedekiah    and    his    people;    hence    He    gave    them    <br\/>\r\nthe    opportunity    to    choose    between    life    and    death.    Although    the    king    was    hoping    to    <br\/>\r\nreceive    a    message    of    hope    but    none    was    forthcoming.    Instead,    Jeremiah    gave    a    <br\/>\r\nmessage    that    they    should    surrender    to    the    Babylonians    that    had    besieged    them.    <br\/>\r\nGod's    love    and    mercy    are    incomparable    as    it    is    reflected    in    the    passage.    He    shows    <br\/>\r\nlove    and    mercy    to    people,    even    the    worst    sinner.    Despite    the    fact    that    Zedekiah    and    <br\/>\r\nhis    people    deliberately    refused    to    yield    to    God's    warnings,    He    still    offered    them    a    <br\/>\r\nchoice    to    make    good    decision    of    surrendering    to    the    Babylonians    instead    of    total    <br\/>\r\nelimination.    God    has    always    given    His    children    the    privilege    to    accept    the    offer    of    <br\/>\r\nthe    gift    of    salvation    through    the    sacrificial    death    of    His    Son    Jesus    Christ    and    to    <br\/>\r\nmaintain    a    steady    relationship    with    Him.        <\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

However,     two     things     were    <br\/>\r\nparamount.

Its    <br\/>\r\nnegative     effect     in     any     society     cannot     be     over-emphasised.

Unfortunately, the reality of the proverb is gradually eroding from the society. We live in an era that is characterised by oppression, injustice, hatred and wickedness so much that the difference between the rich and the poor is apparent. Innocent people, foreigners, widows and orphans are sometimes treated unjustly because they are poor and cannot defend themselves. Sadly, the guilty but rich people are set free, even when it is obvious that they are on the wrong side of the law. A very good example is the case of some politicians who were contesting for the same position during an election. The campaign and strategies of one of them and his party were so intimidating that the other party planned and assassinated the other man. The identity of the assassin was later discovered but because of the influence of some other top politicians, an innocent person was arrested and prosecuted while the murderer was discharged and acquitted. How often do such acts of injustice prevail in our society when the vulnerable are voiceless and denied their right? The practice of injustice and inequality was also prevalent in the days of Jeremiah, especially among the leaders, despite Gods warnings. The focus of todays lesson is Gods warning message through Prophet Jeremiah to the king of Judah, his officials and people who came through the gates to repent of their injustice and practise equality.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. A Call to Do Justice and the Reward Jeremiah 22:1-4 God did not relent in His effort to make the people of Jerusalem realise their acts of injustice and repent. According to this passage, the call to do justice was specifically directed to the royal house of Judah. God commanded Prophet Jeremiah to go to the palace of the King of Judah, the descendants of David and make a proclamation to the king, the officials and the people. They were commanded to: \u00b7 Do what was right and just. In other words, they were expected to practise justice and fairness without discrimination, tribe, status, and gender notwithstanding. \u00b7 Rescue the oppressed from their oppressors. \u00b7 Stop violence against foreigners, the fatherless and the widows Stop the shedding of innocent blood. The other aspect of Jeremiahs message to the people was the reward that goes with strict adherence of the command to practise justice. God confirmed His reward for those who would obey the commands in verse 4. He said, Davids descendants would continue to be kings. Furthermore, they, their officials and the people would continually pass through the gates of the palace in chariots and horses. Gods call to the people of Jerusalem to repent of their injustice is also applicable to the contemporary society because of the high level of injustice. There is oppression, favouritism, cheating, incessant killing, and corruption. Many are denied their rights, especially the defenceless. Worse still, the judiciary, which used to be the last hope of the poor is no longer affordable by the commoners. Nevertheless, the same message God gave to the people through Prophet Jeremiah is suitable for present-day believers. Specifically, Gods command to act rightly was to the leaders of Jerusalem because if leaders are right and just, it will spread to their subordinates. There will be no oppression, cheating and injustice in the society. Therefore, leaders at various levels should embrace fair treatment to all and shun any form of prejudice so that there will be peace, equity and harmony among the people, irrespective of their status, tribe or gender<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

Consequences of Disobeying Gods Commands Jeremiah 22:5-7 Gods message to the people of Jerusalem through Jeremiah was balanced. The message contained the reward of obedience and the consequences of disobedience to the commands. God took an oath to make the royal palace fall into ruins, if the people failed to obey His commands. Despite the beauty of the royal palace that was compared with the land of Gilead and the Lebanon Mountains, (these are areas which were known for their thick forest), He promised to make it a desolate place. He also vowed to send destroyers with their weapons to cut up their fine cedar beams and throw them into the fire (v. 7). This promise was fulfilled when the royal palace was set on fire and all the houses of Jerusalem (Jeremiah 52:13). It is obvious from the passage that the continuous disobedience of the kings and the people of Jerusalem angered God. This necessitated Gods pronouncement of making the place desolate and to send destroyers against those who would not obey His commands to practise justice. This is another proof that God hates injustice. Even though He is not interested in destroying the works of His hands, the sins of humankind will always end in punishment. When people refuse to do the will of God definitely, His wrath and judgment will come upon them just like the case of the people of Jerusalem who deliberately disobeyed Gods command. Consequently, God vowed to make the beautiful land desolate. Gods judgment upon His disobedient people can be made manifest in different ways. It could be famine, sickness and diseases, oppression from enemies, death and so on. However, to avert Gods judgment, Christians should be willing to obey God and His commands. Whenever we sin, we should be ready to repent and demonstrate good leadership lifestyle. We should do what is right always and promote justice according to Gods standard.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1. How does exemplary leadership lifestyle help to promote justice? 2.

Gods Command Jeremiah 22:8-10 Gods verdict to punish the royal house of Judah and make the beautiful city a desolate place was so severe that He swore an oath to perform it (v. 5). The destruction wouldill be ruthless to the point that people from many other nations who would pass through the city would ask one another, Why has the LORD done such thing to this great city? The response of those that knew the history and the beauty of the city would be Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God and have worshipped and served other gods. (v. 9) Ultimately, God sounded a note of warning in verse 10. He said, Do not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss; rather, weep bitterly for him who is exiled, (probably Jehoahaz) because he would never return to his native land again.The dead king for whom the people were not to weep was King Josiah who was killed in a battle. They were only encouraged to weep for his wicked son Jehoahaz who was also known as Shallum (Jeremiah 22:1). Even though his father was a fearful and godly king, his son did not follow his footsteps. God is compassionate but He will not fail to punish every sinful act. The punishment upon Judah was as a result of their sin. They did not maintain a cordial relationship with God, despite His faithfulness to them. They forsook His covenant relationship with them and deliberately ignored the several warnings to return to Him through His prophets. They forgot that Gods decision to destroy any wicked nation that had failed to repent and return to Him was not negotiable. This is a reminder that Christians should exhibit exemplary leadership lifestyle so that the upcoming generation will follow their examples and be able to maintain justice, peace and demonstrate total obedience to Gods laws. Any attempt by any individual or nation to dishonour God by disobeying His laws will surely attract His wrath, like the case of the people of Judah.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1.

She began to weep profusely. Every attempt to console and ask the reason for her sorrowful mood proved unsuccessful. After a while, she narrated the misbehaviour of her only son who suddenly became wayward, despite her effort to give him the best education, clothing, food and other essential care, since the death of her husband. At intervals, the woman sobbed and wiped her tears saying, Pastor, please pray for me. I want my child to come back to me, though it seems he deserves no mercy because he had gone astray. I still love him as my only child. The book of Hosea gives a picture of a troubled nation where injustice against the poor was widely practised, disregard for Gods will, and the worship of Baal and Asherah, which God detests. Throughout the years of Israels history from Egypt and all He did for them, they rejected His love. In the midst of these, Hosea announced Gods judgment on them as an attempt to bring them to repentance as a new way of life (Hosea 10:9-10). But God decided to show sincere love to His rebellious people as a husband loves his bride. He, however, warned them to return to Him so that their future would not be worse than their past.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Gods Sincere Love for Israel Hosea 11:1-2 The nation of Israel was not appreciative of Gods faithfulness to her. Even though she was Gods bride (Ezekiel 16:8-15), she forsook Him and His laws. The nation wasinfluenced by her neighbouring nations and began to worship other gods, as a married woman yields her body to another man. Despite Gods earlier warning to Israel against idolatry and the promise to use her enemy to punish her (Hosea 9), they did not change their ways. He eventually announced His love for them in order to relieve the gloom of His previous condemnations. According to verse 1, God said, When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt, I called my son. Unfortunately, the more God called the people, the more they remained defiant. Instead of returning to Him, they continued to practise idolatry by offering sacrifices to Baal and burning incense to images. When God heard the cry of the children of Israel, He provided a way of bringing them out of Egypt through His servant Moses as a sign of His sincere love for them. Gods very nature is to love His people as a husband loves his bride. The author of first John describes God as love and whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in Him (1 John 4:16b). Out of His abundant love, He promised to bless Abraham and make him the father of many nations (Genesis 15:1-5). He miraculously delivered the Israelites from their slave masters and promised never to forsake them. God still seeks sinners and wants them to return to Him in true repentance. Christians can emulate Gods sincere love for Israel by loving one another, practising justice, living in righteousness and demonstrating faithfulness to one another. In all, believers should show love to one another, even those who do not see the need to reciprocate their love. This can be done in several ways like showing little kindness, praying, visiting, and encouraging people, and giving godly counsel and discipleship.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

Compare Gods love for Israel since they left the land of Egypt and relate it to His love for Christians.<\/p>\r\n","lesson2":"<p>A. Gods Promised Mercy Hosea 11:7-10; 12:1-2 Beginning from verse 3, God analysed His benefits to Ephraim, despite the fact that they failed to repent and return to Him. Subsequently, He reversed His determination in verse 6 to sweep through their cities, breakdown the city gates and put an end to their plans. His compassion was aroused again and He promised not to punish them in His anger, give up nor hand them over to their enemies because of His Divine nature (v. 9). He said, I will not treat you like Admah and will not make you like Zeboiim (the two cities that were destroyed with Sodom and Gomorrah). Unfortunately, Israels wickedness increased as they made treaty with Assyria and Egypt. He resolved to punish Judah and Jacob in accordance to their deeds (Hosea 12:1-2). Despite Gods unceasing love and mercy for Israel, they remained unfaithful to Him. They were full of lies and violence and were not ready to change from their evil ways. Sadly, they aligned with the Assyrians and Egyptians who worshipped idols and forgot the living God that brought them out of the land of Egypt. Even today, many have turned away from God. They compromise their faith because of position, fame, wealth, promotion and prosperity without remembering Gods standard for them as believers. Regardless of Gods constant warnings and reminder of the consequences of their actions, they remained disobedient. Some intentionally disobey God and have refused to return to Him in true repentance with the excuse that He is merciful. The summary of the lesson is that Christians should not undermine Gods mercy and continue to indulge in sin because the consequences will surely come and could be unbearable.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

God Urges Israel to Return to Him Hosea 12:6-14 God did not relent in His effort to make the people return to Him in love and justice. Emphatically, He said in verse 6, But you must return to your God; maintain love and justice, and wait for your God always. The admonition is followed with the pronouncement of judgment on Israel because of their falsehood and the merchants who used dishonest scales and defrauded the people. Worse still, Ephraim boasted of their ill-gotten wealth with the assumption that they would not be found guilty. God warned that they should return to Him and maintain love and justice, otherwise He would make them live in tents again as in the days of old. Gods several warnings to the people of Israel to return to Him through the prophets proved unsuccessful. Because Ephraim had aroused Gods anger through cheating and other dishonest acts, yet was proud of his wealth, God promised to repay her with contempt and allow her to suffer the guilt of her bloodshed. There are many wrong teachings these days about prosperity such that many people think it is not possible to be rich, yet be godly. Some Christians have compromised their faith in their bid to acquire wealth. The rich cheat and oppress the underprivileged for their personal gains. The challenge is that Christians should avoid ungodly ways of becoming prosperous and famous because the consequences are unpleasant.

They sometimes feel they do not need God to make success in life provided they are smart and intelligent. They prefer shortcuts and shoddy means to achieve success without regard for God and His words. It is a time when young adults cannot differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable ways of life because they lack the wisdom of God. To them, God is slow; therefore, they must play fast in order to make it. After all, we are in Jet or Computer age. Brother John Adamu grew up with his uncle, a pastor, after his mother died in a fatal motor accident. John had been taught discipline, humility, the fear of God and the importance of maintaining a steady relationship with God as the secret of success. Before he left for the university, his uncle instructed him about life on campus. From time to time he would say, John, if sinners entice you, do not consent (Proverbs 1:10), so much that it became a slogan in his uncles house and a watchword for John. Throughout his university days, John was guided by this admonition and he never compromised his faith, despite pressure from friends to lure him into crime. The focal point of todays lesson is the value of wisdom and the consequences of rejecting it<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. The Value of Proverbs Proverbs 1:1-4 King Solomon is believed to be the author of the book of Proverbs, although there are other evidences of variety of individual writers. It is a collection of the proverbs of King Solomon, the son of David, which was compiled over time. Proverbs is a translation of a Hebrew word Mashal, which means saying. According to the text, the purpose of the proverbs is to teach people particularly young adults wisdom and discipline as key to a successful life. It is also to understand words of insight, to acquire a disciplined and prudent life and to do what is right, just and fair (v. 3). As it is explained in the passage, the reason for the set of the proverbs includes the need to give insight to the simple (v. 4a), knowledge and discernment to the young (v. 4b). These proverbs are necessary because those who know the Lord and the wisdom He gives will definitely know the course of action to follow in life. The purpose of the collective proverbs is aimed at the young and ignorant minds so that they will be guided as they make choices and decisions in life, as they relate with God. In the history of human race, there is no better time than now when the need for wisdom, discipline, discernment and successful living should be promoted. We live in a time when both the old and young make decisions without being mindful of the implications because they lack godly wisdom. This concern perhaps motivated King Solomon to call attention to young people to gain wisdom, discipline, insight, and discernment without which no one will live a fulfilled life that glorifies God. The need for knowledge and discretion to the young is specifically mentioned in verse 4 although they are beneficial both to the mature, immature and ignorant (v. 5).<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

If no, what are some other things needed and if yes, what is your advice for young people?<\/p>\r\n","lesson2":"<p>B. Exhortation to Embrace Wisdom Proverbs 1:7-8, 10-11 The author of Proverbs stated clearly in (verse 7) the source of wisdom. He said, The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline. In other words, reverence for the Lord is the only way to gain true wisdom (Job 28:28; Psalm 111:10), but fools undermine its importance and refuse discipline. The author also encouraged strict obedience to parents instructions as well as warned against enticement by sinners who work subtly to lure people into sin. According to verse 11, the author counselled against any plan from the wicked to either kill or attack innocent people. Lack of wisdom and discipline easily entice young people. Therefore, those who have the fear of God and are wise should be able to stand firm and refute every counsel from the wicked to perpetrate evil. Wisdom is defined by the Mariam-Webster Dictionary as knowledge that is gained by having many experiences in life or the natural ability to understand things that most people cannot understand, or knowledge of what is proper or reasonable. Biblically, wisdom is the same as reverence for God. It is not an intellectual achievement or a matter of acquiring human knowledge; rather, it is understanding, good judgment, or insight, which comes from God (Proverbs 1:29). This means that when we apply Gods wisdom, which is achieved through the fear of God, to lifes situations in a meaningful way, we will be described as wise people. The fear that leads to wisdom is interpreted as awe, reverence or respect for God. Nevertheless, without obedience to Gods commandments and will, one cannot possess divine wisdom. The admonition to embrace the fear of God and obey His Words is for all people. This will help us to discern lifes direction and embrace a type of life that pleases God.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

He spoke like a prophet telling the people both the rewards and punishment of obedience and disobedience to instructions. In verse 20, wisdom is personified as a woman who cries out publicly at the gate way of the fortified city, calling people to embrace wisdom. Her passion and concern for the people to embrace wisdom is stated in verse 22. She said, How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge? The fact that the people refused wisdom, rebuke and discipline, they will be punished because the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them. (v. 32) This implies that the consequences of their choices depend on their actions because the Scripture says a man reaps what he sows (Galatians 6:7). In contrast, anyone who listens to the cry to embrace wisdom will live in safety without any reason to be afraid. The main idea of the passage is the call of wisdom. But the option to reject wisdom and suffer the consequences or accept it and enjoy safety depends on individual choices. In addition, wisdom is described in this passage as crying out in the streets, public places, along the high street and in front of the city gate. These __ places are significant places normal walks of life where people are found. Even today, wisdom is crying out to the rich, poor, old and young because its usefulness is non-negotiable for Christians, especially in this perverse world. Again, we should be reminded of the certainty of the consequences if we reject wisdom as indicated in the passage.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1.

The author begins by addressing his recipient as my son, an indication that the instruction was meant for a younger person. He suggested some conditions through which wisdom could be obtained: \u00b7 To receive his words (v. 1). In other words, the son is expected to listen and believe in his fathers counsel and not resist his opinion. \u00b7 To treasure his commandments (v. 1), or to value it with high esteem. Gods Word is treasured in our hearts as we meditate on it in order to remember it (Psalm 119:11). \u00b7 To turn his ears to wisdom and apply his heart to understanding (v. 2): This means to submit, pay close attention or to obey his instructions with utmost devotion. \u00b7 To call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding (v. 3). The counsel here is to obtain wisdom with fervent spirit and passion. \u00b7 To look for it as silver and hidden treasure (v. 4). Ultimately, these conditions are the prerequisites for obtaining wisdom. When they are met, one will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God (the stage of knowing God personally). Wisdom is so important that we must search for it with great eagerness. We must do everything within our power to obtain it by avoiding all forms of distractions. These days, it seems many people particularly, the young ones despise the instruction of their parents, just like Israel did not listen to Gods prophets and they became captives in Babylon (2 Chronicles 24:19; 33:10). The admonition from the author of the book to his beloved son to listen to his instructions and never forget them is applicable to all believers. When we obey these instructions, then, we will know what it means to fear and succeed in learning about God. More importantly, we should be ready to meet the above conditions as taught throughout this book of Proverbs.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

Discuss the benefits of having the fear of God and His knowledge?<\/p>\r\n","lesson2":"<p>B. The Worth of Gods Wisdom Proverbs 2:6-8 The search for wisdom like silver and hidden treasure leads to knowledge and understanding. This is confirmed in verse 6, that wisdom is a gift from God and from His mouth come knowledge and understanding. Among the benefits of wisdom is that God holds victory and security for the righteous and protects those who are blameless (those with spiritual and moral integrity). Furthermore, He guards the course of the righteous and provides security for those who are devoted to Him. Wisdom, knowledge and understanding are the ability to judge rightly knowing the moral and practical solution to difficult situations. They are the means by which one can identify and differentiate between truth and error, right and wrong, good and evil. Anyone who possesses these godly virtues will definitely live a righteous life that pleases God. According to the passage, God possesses wisdom and gives it to those who search for it with great zeal like silver and hidden treasure (v. 4). Also, noticeable in the passage is Gods promise to provide strong protection for the upright, not only during their lifetime on earth but also guarantees that they will be safe in the day of judgment (Matthew 7:21-23; 2 Peter 1:5-11). Furthermore, He will guide the paths and preserve the way of the saints who seek Him for wisdom (v. 8). However, these blessings are exclusively reserved for those who fear God and earnestly seek for His wisdom.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1. Why do people value wealth above divine wisdom?

Benefits of Gods Wisdom Proverbs 2:9-11 The instruction of the author is comprehensive because of his ability to describe the conditions for obtaining wisdom, the value and benefits. According to this passage, anyone who possesses the wisdom of God stands to enjoy the following: \u00b7 The ability to know what is right, fair and just in every good thing. It implies that the person will be guided in his decision and choices without errors. Wisdom will be at the centre of his heart just as the words of a wise man are sweet to the soul of another (Proverbs 16:24). \u00b7 Knowledge will be pleasant to his soul. \u00b7 He will be guarded by discretion, and understanding will guide him as God guides the faithful (v. 8). The implication of these benefits is that those who possess the wisdom of God will know and do what is acceptable and pleasing to God. They will be fair and impartial in their dealings with people of different status. When a humankinds thoughts and actions please God, then they will certainly please other humankind (Proverbs 3:1- 4). He will also be trusted by others because they know him for being forthright. Little wonder the author cried loudly and repeatedly calling the attention of his son not to ignore his words but to turn to wisdom and apply his heart unto understanding (v. 2).<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1.

From their childhood days, their choices have been the same without alteration from their parents. They have always enjoyed and treasured the idea of living and doing things together throughout their primary and secondary schools. Having passed out from secondary school in anticipation of going into the university, they were both given the opportunity to make choices of what they wanted and why in writing. In her request, Grace wished to become the SUG President so that she would be respected by all the students. But Mercy simply asked for Gods wisdom to excel in her studies so that she would remain the pride of her parents and be great in life. Although a little bit disturbed about the request made by Grace, their parents took time to explain to them over and over again, the positive nature of wisdom, the gifts and the necessity to embrace it as they aspire to enter into the university. The choice of self-gratification Grace made is an indication that people search for recognition in life with passion and everything it takes. Nevertheless, the treasure of wisdom is more valuable than riches because it guides a persons heart, will, and thought toward obeying and trusting God. The lesson of today is a reminder that we should be ready to go extra mile in seeking wisdom and in helping others around us so that the world will be a better place to live in<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. A Call to Choose Wisdom Proverbs 8:8-14 Wisdom is personified as a female calling people from all over (the streets, marketplaces, at the city gates, hilltops and roadsides) to listen to her excellent words (Proverbs 1:20; 8:1-6). She became more specific in v. 8 when she said, All the words of my mouth are just; none of them is crooked or perverse. By implication, her words are clear to those who have wisdom and plain to those who have knowledge. Based on this, she counselled that her instructions should be preferred to silver, desired than the finest gold and searched for than precious rubies. Therefore, wisdom has no comparison in terms of its worth. From verse 13, the writer stated some of the gifts of wisdom. For instance: \u00b7 She dwells with prudence, possesses knowledge and discretion. \u00b7 She hates pride, arrogance, evil behaviour and false words. \u00b7 She counsels, gives sound judgment, possesses understanding and powerTherefore, she is able to make plans and execute them wisely. Wisdom is so important to humans that the author opens the passage with a call for it. However, it should be noted that the wisdom of God is quite the opposite of the wisdom of humankind. As it is stated above, Gods wisdom is characterised by caution, good judgment and understanding. It is not proud; it does not exhibit bad bevaviour or associate with falsehood and perverseness unlike the wisdom of the world. Usually, worldly wisdom is hasty, conceited and takes glory in itself. The admonition for Christians, therefore, is that the wisdom of God should be sought for by all humankind passionately because of its importance. In addition, wisdom will help those in leadership positions to be just and not live crooked and perverse lives as they lead (v. 16). Ultimately, they will be guided in making right decisions that will be beneficial to humankind and glorify God.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1. The author recommended choosing wisdom rather than silver and gold in verse 10. Discuss how easy it will be for people to comply with this instruction. 2. To fear the Lord is to hate evil (v. 13b). Discuss.<\/p>\r\n","lesson2":"<p>B. The Positive Nature of Wisdom Proverbs 8:17-21 The benefits and positive nature of wisdom cannot be overemphasised. From verse 17, she speaks and describes her nature and talents positively. She said, I love those who love me, and those who seek me find me. In other words, her love is reciprocal and those who passionately desire to have her will find her. After all, riches, honour, enduring wealth and prosperity are found in her and so, her fruit is better than silver and other precious materials. Furthermore, it is the nature of wisdom to walk in the way of righteousness and follow the path of justice. She bestows wealth on those who love her and fill their treasuries (v. 21). This means that wealth is portrayed as wisdoms gift to those who love her. When a man gets wisdom from God, he will be able to give the right counsel and sound judgment, especially in difficult cases. A typical example is the case of Solomon, who was able to give godly counsel in a difficult situation and place the nation of Israel on a higher platform of honour and power (1 Kings 3:16-28). Even though we live in a society where some people crave for the acquisition of material things and wealth above Gods wisdom, Christians should not undermine its importance in their daily walk. Consequently, when divine wisdom is embraced, the person stands to enjoy some benefits such as to govern, rule and give godly decrees, according to Gods standard. The benefit of a rich inheritance on those who live and treasure the nature of wisdom is also guaranteed.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1. How can we find the wisdom of God? Verse 17. 2.

He often told them to pursue and embrace wisdom, to avoid folly, which easily leads to ruin. After his death, his two sons were left in the care of their uncle who was an entrepreneur in the city. Not long after, they began to exhibit their ill-mannered behaviour, despite their fathers warning before his death. Each time their uncle corrected them, they would leave the home for some days without informing him of their whereabouts. After sometime, the younger boy realised his mistakes and decided to return to his uncle with the promise never to be naughty. He became an advocate of good behaviour. At last, he was able to admonish his brother that Stupidity and the refusal to learn from wisdom brings destruction and death, but safety and security come from listening to her. Eventually, they both became responsible young adults and soon became employers of labour, as evidence of walking in the path of wisdom. Todays lesson focuses on the comparison between wisdom and stupidity. It shows that while wisdom leads to life and prosperity, stupidity leads to ruin and shame. Any man who finds wisdom is blessed and nothing in life can be compared with the benefits it offers, not even silver or gold. Similarly, the ways of folly lead to death. As a matter of fact, a Christian who lacks the wisdom of God will definitely live a frustrated life. So, wisdom is the principal thing in life. It is confirmed in the Scriptures that God created the whole universe together with wisdom (Proverbs 8:22-30). Therefore, everyone who desires to live well must embrace wisdom and enjoy the benefits it offers.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Wisdoms Invitation to Life Proverbs 9:1-6 The writer continues to personify wisdom as a woman (a feminine noun in Hebrew, Proverbs 1:20; 8:1-4). According to this passage, the author outlined the efforts of wisdom and her invitation to people to her house, having made seven pillars, prepared a feast and the table. Then, she sent out invitation from the highest point of the city saying, Let all who are simple come in here! She says to those who lack judgment. Come, eat my food and drink the wine I have mixed.(vv. 4-5) The invitation was sent to the simple and those who lack judgment. The invitation was concluded with a strong admonition to her recipient to leave the company of ignorant people and live. Her encouragement to her invitees was to follow the path of knowledge so that they would live. Simply put, the author meant the gift of wisdom is the pathwayto life and prosperity. Apparently, wisdoms activity of building, preparing a feast, and invitating people to her house is in sharp contrast with the foolish woman, who simply sits at the door of her house calling to passers-by with the offer to take the stolen water and bread (v. 17). Nevertheless, wisdoms gift to humanity is symbolically represented in the passage as a great banquet. Wisdom beckons on the simple (possibly those who can easily be led astray) and those who lack judgment. She calls them to a special feast that leads to life and the way of understanding. Even today, God is still calling people to receive the free gift of wisdom (James 1:5) but unfortunately, many refused to harken and have gone astray because they have failed to walk in the path of Gods wisdom. They have ignored the benefits of walking in the path of wisdom. It is so important that the author repeatedly calls his sons attention to wisdom. In particular, he described it as a tree of life to those who embrace her and those who lay hold of her will be blessed (Proverbs 3:18). The counsel for believers is to avail themselves the opportunity to receive this free offer so that they will live meaningful, responsible lives and ultimately reign with Christ in His glory.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

The Origin of Wisdom Proverbs 9:8-10 The author of Proverbs differentiated between the responses of the wise and foolish to the invitation of wisdom. The preceding verses say anyone who corrects a mocker invites insult and he who corrects a wicked man will incur abuse (v. 7). In verses 8 and 9, he sounded a note of warning saying, Do not rebuke a mocker or he will hate you; rebuke a wise man and he will love you. Instruct a wise man and he will be wiser still; teach a righteous man and he will add to his learning. Thereafter, he identified the fear of the Lord as the source and beginning of wisdom and knowledge of the Holy One (v. 10). Supposedly, the feast of the wisdom described in verse 3 is an invitation to encounter God who is the source of divine wisdom. Unfortunately, the mocker mentioned in verse 8 cannot respond positively to rebuke because apart from the fact that the seed (Christ) of God is not in him, he lacks divine wisdom and the ability to distinguish between what is right and evil. In contrast, the one who possesses wisdom because he fears the Lord becomes wiser and increases in learning whenever he is rebuked, instructed and taught. The Scripture says that God has given us His Word for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness (2 Timothy 3:16). Interestingly, the passage clearly states the benefits of accepting rebuke or correction. Such a person will love God, grow wiser and add to his learning. Nevertheless, our disposition as Christians will go a long way to show whether we are wise or mockers. Anyone who desires to grow wiser and more knowledgeable should be ready to see and accept rebuke as a pathway to greatness, honour, riches and life (Proverbs 3:18-19).<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

The Ways of the Folly Proverbs 9:13-18 The author of Proverbs also identified and analysed the ways of folly that it leads to death. The passage starts with the characteristics of folly, which includes being loud, indisciplined and shameless, without knowledge or good judgment. Besides, folly is compared, in some ways, with wisdom: Unlike wisdom that carefully built her house and erected seven pillars before her invitation to the ignorant, folly is described in verses 14-17 as: \u00b7 Sitting at the door of her house on a seat at the highest point of the city. \u00b7 Calling to those who pass by on their way. \u00b7 Inviting the simple and those who lack judgment to come and eat food and drink mixed wine. She [folly] says, Stolen bread is sweet; food eaten in secret is delicious. Unfortunately, her victims do not know the implication of the invitation. So, those who have responded are already deep in the world of the dead (v. 18), because her house is a pathway to the grave. In fact, wisdom and folly used the same language but while wisdoms feast leads to maturity, insight, and life, the foolish womans deceptive offer leads to death (vv. 4, 16). Nevertheless, it is important to note that wisdom is Christ personified and He offers life, whereas folly represents the Devil whose ways lead to death. Christians should be careful not to be deceived with the offer from the foolish woman to drink the stolen water she described as sweet (v. 17). In fact, it is bitter and the consequence of yielding to the offer is death.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1.

A story was told of a professor who went to another university in another state as an external examiner to some final year students. On his arrival at the campus, he met and made inquiry from a young lady for direction to the university guesthouse, where he was to be lodged. Unfortunately, the lady sounded unfriendly. She was neither polite nor willing to direct the man probably because of his poor looking appearance. Few days later, the lady was shocked when she met face to face with the same man she did not treat politely, as her external examiner. If you were the professor, what would have been your assessment of the lady, based on her poor attitude towards you? The lesson for today focuses on the ministry of John the Baptist, when he was rounding off. John the Baptist was the forerunner of Jesus Christ. His mission was to prepare the people of Israel for the coming of the long-awaited Messiah thus his message centred on repentance. Those who repented were baptised. However, towards the end of his ministry, he was imprisoned by Antipas, son of Herod the great. John expected Jesus to come to his rescue but Jesus reply reminded him of the real reasons he came to the world (Isaiah 35:5-6; 61:1), which he was fulfilling. Jesus is the Messiah whose prediction was confirmed by some Old Testament prophets like Moses in Genesis 3:15; Deuteronomy 18:15; Isaiah 7:14; 9:6; Micah 5:2; and Zechariah 9:9.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. The True Identity of John the Baptist Matthew 11:7-11 The character of John the Baptist, where he lived, his dressing, food and the messages of repentance he preached (Mark 1:1, 6) made the people of his days to have different opinions about Him. Before Jesus public ministry, John was imprisoned but when he heard about the teachings and miracles of Jesus Christ, he sent some of his disciples to inquire if He was truly the Messiah. Perhaps John felt that what Jesus was doing did not match what he had said about the One who would come after him (Matthew 3:7-12). Jesus answer indicates that the miracles were sufficient evidence of His messiahship. It means that Jesus expected John the Baptist to recognise His identity as the Messiah from the miracles He was performing. He, however, spoke about His true identity as more than a prophet. He said, This is the one about whom it is written: I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.(v. 10) Jesus further testified that none among humankind is greater than John, yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than him. Jesus response to John through his disciples was an avenue to confirm the true identity of John, contrary to peoples view. He said John was not a reed swayed by the wind or a man dressed in fine clothes like people in the kings palace. He affirmed that he is a prophet of God who ushered in the long-awaited Messiah with a specific message for the nation of Israel. Although John saw Christ, he did not have the opportunity of preaching the total plan of God for the salvation of humankind after it was fulfilled. John died before the events that brought about the salvation of humankind. So he did not preach the gospel of salvation based on the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ, according to the New Testament. Nevertheless, his ministry cannot be undermined because many believed, confessed their sins and were baptised through it. D<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

The Nature of the Kingdom Matthew 11:12-15 Jesus repeatedly describes the nature of the kingdom using various symbols and parables. Having explained the identity of John the Baptist, He revealed the characteristics of the kingdom. He said in verse 12, From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it. Although it is extremely difficult to identify the forceful men who took hold of the kingdom but some Bible commentators believe it was those who persecuted the Christian community. Interestingly, ever before John, the prophets and the Law had prophesied and those who believe their message know that John is the Elijah whose coming was long predicted (Malachi 4:5). Jesus concluded with a wise saying that those who have ears should listen. According to Matthew chapter 3, many people responded to the message of John as they went to him from Jerusalem, all Judea and the whole region of Jordan. They confessed their sins and were baptised in River Jordan. In the days of Jesus, while some believed His message others did not, but more importantly, they both preached the gospel message with zeal and power. Johns ministry pointed the people to Jesus. Those who have eagerly waited forthe promised Messiah received with great zeal the salvation of God through Jesus Christ. Since then until now, the kingdom has been forcefully advancing, even in the face of severe persecution like the days of John. He ministered with the Spirit and __ power and that made him fit into the description of an earlier prophet Elias or Elijah to which Jesus referred to as whose coming had been predicted (Micah 4:5- 6). Jesus, however, emphasised that this revelation is not subject to arguments or debate, only people who have ears for the things of the Spirit can believe it.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

Wisdom Vindicated by Her Deeds Matthew 11:16-19 The people of John and Jesus days were peculiar in their ways. They posed resistance to the message of salvation as preached by them. This is confirmed in Jesus statement in verse 16 when He likened them to children who sit in the marketplace calling out to others saying, We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn. (v. 17) The Jews acted like children as they refused to respond to the messages of repentance and salvation of John and Jesus Christ. The ministry of John was unique because he fasted and drank no wine, yet he was said to have demons. On the contrary, Jesus who ate and drank was criticised and nicknamed a glutton, a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners. But He declared that wisdom is proved right (vindicated) by her actions and to recognise what is fitting such as playing wedding music for a wedding ceremony and playing dirge for funerals. Similarly, His statement in Luke 7:35 confirms that wisdom is vindicated by her children. The saying that human beings are difficult to please is clearly seen in this passage. John the Baptist lived in isolation and abstained from social life, yet the __ people called him a demon. The lifestyle of Jesus was the opposite He was available to all, yet the people made excuses that He was a friend of sinners. Interestingly, He declared that by the testimonies of the mighty works of God through His ministry, the people will be convinced beyond doubts that He was the wisdom that God provided for the salvation of humankind.

He was always admired by his friends, teachers and family members because of his rapid growth and display of wisdom. Nevertheless, his parents were not too surprised when these qualities began to manifest because it was prophesied before his birth that he would be great and exceptionally intelligent. His parents usually felt he was acting beyond his age. From time to time, while talking to Him, Josephs parent made reference to the book of Ecclesiastes that there is time for everything and a season for every activity under heaven. Apart from other areas he had displayed exceptional performance, Joseph had done extremely well in sporting activities and represented his school both at the local and national levels. One day after school, his parents were surprised that Joseph did not return home and so they became apprehensive and reported to the police. Upon investigation, it was discovered that Joseph had travelled to a neighbouring town to represent his school in a football match, without informing his parents. He assumed his parents knew of his proposed journey. When he eventually returned home, his parents reminded him of his age and counselled him to wait until he is fully mature to adulthood before taking decisions on his own. He was counselled from Ecclesiastes chapter 3. Todays lesson centres on the display of Jesus wisdom and how He related with the temple scholars to the amazement of the people. When Joseph and Mary finally found Him after three days search, they were surprised at His expression about His passion for His Fathers work. Nevertheless, Jesus demonstrated obedience and went home with His parents to Nazareth, where He continued the work of ministry.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Jesus Grows in Wisdom Ecclesiastes 3:1, 7b; Luke 2:39-40 The author of the book of Ecclesiastes attests to the fact that God has designed everything in life so much so that there is a particular time for everything and a season for every activity (Ecclesiastes 3:1). Jesus was presented in the temple on the eighth day to be circumcised and for the ceremony of purification according to the Mosaic Law Concerning a male child that opened the womb (Luke 2:23). Having performed everything according to the law of the Lord, Mary and Joseph returned to their hometown, Nazareth in Galilee. According to verse 40, four things were noticeable in the life of Jesus: He grew and became strong. He was filled with an amazing wisdom and Gods blessings were upon Him. Apparently, Jesus parents played a significant role in preparing Him for the work of ministry. They demonstrated obedience in the fulfilment of the Old Testament law of consecrating every firstborn child to the Lord and offered sacrifices when they took Him to Jerusalem, even though they knew He is the Saviour of the world. As Jesus continued in His ministry, He exhibited the qualities mentioned in verse 40, particularly in His relationship with people. With divine wisdom, He was able to relate with the Pharisees and scribes who constantly argued and accused Him. His style of teaching was uncommon; it was another evidence of divine wisdom in His life. Above all, Gods favour was upon Him throughout His earthly ministry. The lesson here is that it is important for Christian parents to properly guide their children, especially gifted children, in order to fulfil their destiny. They should not undermine the importance of prayers, godly counsel, spiritual guidance and exemplary lifestyle so that such children can grow in wisdom and enjoy the blessings of God while fulfilling the purpose of God for their lives.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

Jesus at the Temple Luke 2:41-47 Every stage in the life of Jesus was significant with an outstanding experience. It was customary for the Jews to embark on three pilgrimages to Jerusalem each year: the Passover \/Unleavened Bread (Exodus 12:6, 15-20), the Pentecost (Leviticus 23:15-21), and the Feast of Tabernacles (Exodus 23:16b). Jesus parents have always participated in these events, so the temple experience was already a familiar one to Jesus. At age twelve, Mary and Joseph took their Son, Jesus to the Feast according to their tradition, but they never envisaged anything strange. When the Feast was over, Mary and Joseph returned home but Jesus stayed back without the awareness of His parents. They thought He was in their company probably because of the numbers of visitors that flocked Jerusalem for the Feast. So, they had no reason to suspect He was missing until they began to look for Him among their relatives. At last, He was found on the third day in the temple sitting among Jewish teachers, listening to them and asking questions. The climax was that everyone who heard Him was amazed at the display of wisdom and His intelligent answers. It was indeed an uncommon wisdom that amazed the people. Jesus display of wisdom among the teachers was remarkable and an indication that He was raised by devoted Jewish parents, not forgetting that He is the Son of God. His presence and discourse with the teachers (experts in Judaism) in the temple further showed His foundation in the Law and the Prophets. Instead of being interested in eating, drinking, buying, selling and merry-making, He was utterly engrossed in the teaching in the temple that He did not bother about His parents that they would be searching for Him. Jesus presence at the temple was significant, especially the display of His knowledge on the written Word of God, which amazed His listeners (v. 47). He certainly understood the nature of His ministry and was ready to fulfil it.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

Even though He is the Saviour, He demonstrated outright obedience to His parents. On the third day, His parents found Him in the temple and were astonished. Then, they expressed their displeasure at His actions and the trouble He had caused them. His mother said to Him, Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you. (v. 48) Jesus reply was amazing. He said, Why were you searching for me? Didnt you know I had to be in my Fathers house? (v. 49)In other words, His parents ought to know that He would be involved in His Fathers business, which is teaching people the Word of God. Nevertheless, Jesus response indicated that His relationship with His heavenly Father was of greater importance than being with His earthly parents (Mary and Joseph). Unfortunately, they did not understand what He was saying to them. Nevertheless, Jesus demonstrated obedience and went back with His parents to Nazareth. According to verse 51b, even though His parents did not fully comprehend the implication of His reply, Mary treasured everything in her heart. Jesus continued to grow in wisdom and stature and in favour with God and humankind. Little wonder His ministry was characterised by signs, wonders and salvation. Jesus was exemplary in all His ways. His life and ministry was characterised by wisdom that seems beyond His age. Despite the fact that His reply seemed harsh to His parents in verse 49, He did not mean to upset them. He only made them realise that His priority was to honour and do the work of His Father. That was why He followed them home immediately. Although Jesus is God, He was submissive to His parents. Unlike some children and youths in our days that are disobedient probably because they are gifted in some areas and earn money to make ends meet in the family. Jesus taught here the need for children to obey their parents. On the other hand, Christian parents should endeavour to train their children to be involved in church programmes and activities, fellowship with others (Hebrews 10:25) to enhance their spiritual development.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1.

After his secondary education, he had a sense of Gods calling into the full gospel ministry. With fear and skepticism, Timothy decided to finish his university education before he finally made up his mind to be trained as a pastor. While he was in training, he never received any help from his family members because they were not in support of his decision. After his graduation, he became a music minister in a Baptist church in his hometown. Pastor Timothy was hard-working, talented in music and the playing of musical instruments. Unfortunately, his people had no regard for him and his God-given gifts. Interestingly, the first concert he organised, the success of the programme and the number of people that attended made people to marvel about his gifts. They marvelled and began to ask one another, Is this young Timothy Alagunme with whom we grew? What is the secret of his success? Soon, Pastor Timothy became a popular and respected person among his people because of his giftedness. The focus of todays lesson is on the ministry of Jesus among His people. For the first time, He encountered skepticism and because of their lack of faith, He did not perform many miracles in His hometown. His people did not recognise Him as the Saviour of the world but more of a carpenters son, member of the family of Joseph whose brothers and sisters they knew so well. They did not see Him as the promised Messiah. Little wonder people often say, Familiarity breeds contempt. Throughout Jesus ministry on earth, He demonstrated wisdom, integrity and exemplary lifestyle.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Jesus Rejection by His people Mark 6:1-3 Jesus ministry was characterised with signs and wonders. As a result, a large crowd always followed Him. Specifically, the healing of the woman with the issue of blood and Jairus daughter who was raised back to life made the people amazed (Mark 5:25-43). After performing these miracles, Jesus left for His hometown with His disciples. He began to teach on the Sabbath in the synagogue. When the people heard Him, they were amazed and confused about His true identity. In their state of confusion, they began to ask one another: \u00b7 Where did this man get these things? (His wisdom, power and authority). \u00b7 What is the wisdom that has been given to Him that He even does miracles? \u00b7 Is He not the carpenter? \u00b7 Is He not Marys son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? \u00b7 Are His sisters not here with us? Having pondered on these questions, they took offence and rejected Him. The people lacked the understanding that God is the source of Jesus authority, power and wisdom with which He wrought miracles among the people. Apparently, Jesus intention was to extend the message of salvation to His people with the expectation that they would gladly receive it. Unfortunately, instead of them to embrace the message of salvation, they doubted and perhaps underrated His personality, power and wisdom with which He taught and performed miracles. They were surprised and said, Is this Marys son? In fact, their question of whose son He is was a sign of an indictment because people are usually known and addressed by their fathers name. Even in our contemporary time, people easily look down on some others when they begin to grow and show some surprising insights and gifts. They doubt the genuineness of their ministry and criticise them without proper investigation. The summary of this lesson is that our familiarity with people should not make us reject them and their God-given messages. This means that Christians should be ready to accept anyone who God has commissioned for special assignments without minding their backgrounds, gender, age and profession.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1. Why was it important for Jesus to return to His hometown?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Where did Jesus get the wisdom with which He ministered and how can we get true wisdom and power today<\/p>\r\n","lesson2":"<p>B. The Result of Unbelief Mark 6:4-6 The passion to preach, teach and heal with which Jesus went to His hometown met with strong resistance. Rather than seeing Him as the Saviour and accepting the gospel message, they undervalued His personality. They addressed Him as the son of a carpenter, the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon. They talked about his sisters, his mother Mary and finally rejected Him and His message. Of course with displeasure, Jesus said to them in verse 4, Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honour. Consequently, He did not perform many miracles there except a few who received their healing because the people lacked faith. Their attitude was in contrast to the faith of the centurion who believed that Jesus words could heal his sick servant, and Jesus commended him (Luke 7:9). Sometimes, some people intentionally despise others because of their display of intelligence. They criticise their activities and persuade others to do so without proper investigation of the authenticity of their ministry. They often forget that God can use anybody to accomplish His goal. However, there are consequences when people are in doubt of what God can do and He will not overlook the sin of unbelief. It cannot lead to answered prayer and miracles. The people of Nazareth did not receive enough miracles because they did not believe in the power with which Jesus performed miracles throughout His earthly ministry. They lacked the wisdom to acknowledge Jesus as the Saviour of the world and His ability to work miracles. However, the testimony is that His rejection in His hometown did not stop Him from making progress as He went about teaching, preaching and healing the sick. When we doubt the power of God to work miracles, it can serve as a stumbling block to receiving Gods blessings as it is seen in todays passage.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

A dying father invited all his children to his bedside for an important discussion. Every effort he made to share some important words of wisdom with them proved unsuccessful. According to his first son, their fathers lips were only moving but the voice was not loud enough to hear him. Eventually, the father died without his children hearing what he had to say. So, whenever his children remember the experience, they are pained that despite their fathers effort to counsel them on his death bed, they missed the opportunity. Our lesson today seeks to examine some of the last words of Jesus in His interaction with His disciples before His crucifixion. Chapter 14 of the gospel of John is known as the farewell discourse of Jesus with His disciples. After the washing of the disciples feet, Jesus predicted His betrayal two times in chapter 13. The message of His departure did not go down well with His disciples so, they became worried and upset with the thought of Jesus leaving them. Nevertheless, He reassured them of two important things: His plans to go and prepare a place for them, and His return to take them to be where He is (vv. 1-3). He added that He is the Way, Truth and Life. He promised to do whatever they ask in His Name so that He would bring glory to His Father who is in heaven. <\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Jesus Comforts His Disciples John 14:1-7 Jesus third prediction of His betrayal was followed by a command to His disciples to love one another as He had loved them (John 13:31-35). In His response to Thomas question of where He was going and his desire to follow Him, Jesus comforted them with these words, Do not let your heart be troubled. Trust in God and trust also in me. (v. 1) According to verse 3, Jesus revealed His plan to go and prepare a place for them in His Fathers house and return to take them so that they would be together. Even though Jesus affirmed that they knew the way to where He was going in verse 4, Thomas surprisingly replied, Lord, we dont know where you are going, so how can we know the way? Jesus reply was startling and it formed the foundation of the relationship between Him and His Father. He declared, I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.Jesus meant that He is the way that leads to God, the truth about Him and His will for humanity. He further explained that since the disciples had known Him, they had also known the Father and had seen Him (v. 7).Jesus had worked closely with His disciples and had taught and prepared them to continue with the ministry after His ascension. Over time, He had built a relationship and developed emotional ties with them. Therefore, they became worried and frightened probably of their safety when He announced His death. This, of course, necessitated the words of comfort in verses 1 and 3. He admonished them not to be troubled but that they should put their trust in Him (Jesus) and also in God. More so, He promised them an abode in His Fathers kingdom where He was going, and made them know that He is the Way, Truth and Life. Jesus is not one among many ways but the only Way and without Him, no one can get to the Father. Jesus words of comfort to His disciples are also applicable to all believers in this present-day world in which Christians are being persecuted. Despite the tribulation, we should not be troubled because Jesus has prepared a place for us in His Fathers kingdom where we shall reign with Him eternally.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

Unity between the Father and Son John 14:8-11 Jesus declaration in verse 7 prompted Philip to ask Him to show them the Father. In verse 9, Jesus expressed surprise at Philips ignorance of the unity between Him and His Father, having been together for some time. He said, ...anyone who has seen me has seen the father. How can you say, Show us? Jesus became more specific and explained to Philip about the unity between Him and His Father. He said to him, Dont you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work. (v. 10) He made a categorical statement that they should believe the existing union between Him and the Father because of the miracles which He had wrought among the people. The unity of the Father and Son is a recurrent theme in the gospel of John. Repeatedly, Jesus stressed the intimate relationship between Him and His Father but unfortunately, even though He had been with the disciples for long, they did not recognise the union. His statement in verse 10 suggests that He expected the disciples to have seen the Father in Him. To further convince them of the unity between Himself and His Father, He made reference to the miracles He had performed as proof of their union. Jesus expectation is that anyone who has found Him should not look for the Father anymore because He and His Father are one. This same emphasis is made when John said, No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, who is at the Fathers side, has made him known. (John 1:18) Even in our modern-day, many people are in doubt of the deity of Jesus. Some see Him as a common carpenters son whose personality is not different from everyone else. Little wonder He was disregarded in His hometown. Every Christian is reminded today that Jesus and His Father are One and anyone who has seen Him has seen the Father<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

A Promise of Answered Prayer John 14:12-14 Jesus made adequate preparation as well as gave useful information to His disciples before His departure to the Father. Having explained the intimate relationship between Him and His Father, He made some categorical statements about those who have faith in Him. He said they will do greater things than He has done because He is going to the Father on the basis of the power of the Holy Spirit, which He promised to send (v. 16). He assured them in verse 13 that He will answer their prayers concerning anything they ask for so that the Son might bring glory to the Father. The promise to answer their prayers is repeated in verse 14 with a condition that they must ask in His Name (Jesus). In other words, the Name of Jesus is the key to receiving answers to prayers. It is prayer offered in faith and in accordance with the will of the Father. Jesus departure to His Father was to go and prepare eternal home for His disciples. His ascension also affords us the opportunity to pray to God through Jesus name. According to the passage, three things are vital to receiving answers to our prayers: to pray in the Name of Jesus, faith, and the intention to bring glory to the Father. In contrast, unbelief, lack of faith, and failure to pray in the Name of Jesus can hinder us from receiving answers to our prayers. Therefore, Christians should celebrate the promise of Jesus to prepare a place for His followers and answer us when we pray.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1.

He suffered a lot right from his childhood because of the demise of his parents. Having given His life to Christ during his university days, he began to imagine living a trouble-free life, little did he know that he would experience more challenging moments. He was confronted with the temptation of belonging to a secret cult before he could get a job. One day, he went to his pastor and shared his burden and the temptation to compromise his faith. The pastor patiently listened to his complaints and called his attention to the encouraging words of the first few verses of chapter one of the book of James. Particularly, the pastor reminded him of three important things: the inevitability of trials, the necessity of perseverance and benefit of endurance. At the end, Brother Esesebor went home with renewed faith, knowing that the testing of his faith will result into his spiritual maturity. Faith and wisdom are two important Christian virtues that are needed in the journey of faith. The epistle was written by James who was probably the Lords brother (Galatians 1:19). It was written to the dispersed brethren who were going through trials \/persecutions as a result of their faith. He encouraged them to persevere with joy, regardless of the intensity of their persecution because according to him, trials develop perseverance, which results into producing mature Christians. The lesson focuses on the necessity of perseverance in times of trials and temptations and the reward of such perseverance.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Perseverance: A Mark of Trusted Faith James 1:1-4 The epistle of James who was probably the Lords brother (Galatians 1:19) was not addressed to a particular church or individual. It is a collection of practical instructions written to the brethren (especially the twelve tribes of Israel) who were scattered all over the world as a result of persecution because of their faith (v. 1). According to verses 2 and 3 he said, Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. He added that perseverance must complete its work in them so that they can be mature and complete without lacking anything. In other words, the brethren should consider themselves privileged when their faith is tested and they succeed in such circumstance. He also encouraged them to make sure that their endurance sustains them throughout the period of persecution without compromise. The reason for his counsel is stated in verse 4b: so that they will be perfect and complete without lacking anything. The exhortation to persevere in times of trial was also emphasised in verse 12. Those who are able to stand the test of time will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love Him. James major concern for the persecuted brethren was to persevere, to stick to or to be determined in Gods wisdom to continue to trust God for divine intervention in the midst of persecution. Of course, he knew that the fruits of perseverance will lead to perfection, completion and living in abundance. Apostle Paul corroborated this in his letter to the brethren in Rome. He said, I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. (Romans 8:18) The Scriptures give examples of apostles (Stephen and James) who __ were persecuted to the point of death (Acts 6:8 7:60; 12:1-2) without compromising their faith. James, therefore, encouraged the persecuted believers to persevere with joy, regardless of the intensity of their persecution. Christians are still being persecuted in this contemporary time, especially in the northern part of Nigeria. According to James admonition, they should persevere and not compromise their faith because through perseverance, the faith of believers will be certified to be mature and complete.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

A s k i n g i n F a i t h a n d W i s d o m J a m e s 1 : 5 - 8 James did not only admonish his recipients to endure suffering because it produces fruits of maturity and completion, he also identified faith and wisdom as important Christian virtues needed in the journey of faith. He said in verse 5, If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him. However, he added that when we pray, we must have faith that God is able to do what we ask without any iota of doubt. The encouragement to have faith when we pray was necessitated by the fact that anyone who doubts in prayers is likened to a wave in the sea that is driven and blown about by the wind. Unfortunately, such people will not receive anything from God because they are double-minded and unstable in all their ways. The summary of the lesson is the role of faith in prayer. According to James, true wisdom comes from God and He gives generously to those who ask Him without wavering. He underscores the fact that unwavering faith that stands sure and unperturbed, despite the storms of life is a necessity for prevailing prayer; hence whoever asks for wisdom should have faith in the ability of God to grant the request. Jesus said that all things are possible to him who believes (Mark 9:23). Therefore, Believers need the wisdom of God to live, especially in this corrupt world and we can only receive it as we ask from God. Nevertheless, it should be noted that we cannot receive wisdom or anything from God if we lack corresponding faith in Him. The author of Hebrews says, And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.(Hebrews 11:6)<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

The Poor and Rich Admonished James 1:9-11 This section of James letter reflects both the Old Testament and the teachings of Jesus Christ that God has special concern for the poor; therefore, He will exalt the lowly and will humble the mighty (1 Samuel 2:1-10; Luke 6:20, 24). First, he admonished the poor Christians to be glad in their state of suffering or poverty because they will be exalted but the rich are cautioned to be humble because they can be brought down by God. He likened the life of the rich that fades away to the scorching heat of the sun that withers the plant and destroys its flower and beauty (v. 11). Apostle Peter substantiated this in his first letter when he said, All men are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall .... (1 Peter 1:24). It is most likely that in the days of James, there was disparity in the way people related with both the poor and the rich. Even in the church, the rich were honoured while the poor were despised. But according to James admonition, the financial status of members should not determine their relationship with one another. James made it clear that the position each believer occupies in Christ is not determined by their material wealth but their spiritual state. He thus admonished the believers who are not financially privileged not to demean themselves but to take pride in their spiritual state in God through Christ.

The rules and regulations governing the school were emphasised at the event. The academic activities soon commenced and the students began to struggle between the challenges of either to or not to abide by the rules and regulations. While majority of the students violated the rules and were punished, some abided and were celebrated, like Peter. Peter is from a good Christian home and had been taught to rever God and His Word, as well as to always allow to his words match his actions. Though he was tempted like others to violate the rules of the school but he remained resolute and determined not to tarnish the image of his parents and the name of God. Throughout his stay on campus, there was no record of misbehaviour. His words matched his actions. Peoples perception of him were the same. Soon, he was nicknamed by his colleagues as SU, but he was not deterred by their mockery. At the Schools graduation ceremony, apart from winning virtually all the academic awards, Peter was also given an award as the best well-behaved student. Consequently, he was offered immediate employment. The Bible emphasises the importance of matching our actions with what we learn from the Word of God. In todays text, James stressed the importance of listening to the Word of God and applying it to our lives.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Encouragement to Accept the Word James 1:19-21 The letter of James was addressed to Christians in general (v. 1). From the issues addressed by the author, it seems the Jewish Christians were confronted with personal and relational challenges in the church. Particularly, the problem of communication through the misuse of the tongue was widespread to the point that there was division in the church. In order to overcome the challenge, James wrote and placed great importance on obeying the Word of God. First, he suggested three practical ways to overcome the challenges:<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1. Discuss the dangers of anger in the life of a Christian. 2.

Encouragement to Obey Gods Words James 1:22-25 Whenever God speaks to Christians, He wants us to respond positively. James reminds us in verse 22 that we should not merely listen to the Word of God, and so deceive ourselves; rather, we should do what it says. From verses 23 to 25, he used the imagery of a mirror to explain the meaning of his message. He said, Anyone who listens to the Word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. The mirror analogy suggests how ridiculous it is for believers to simply hear the Word of God without applying it to their daily lives. In contrast, those who look closely to the Word of God look into the perfect law that brings freedom and apply __ what they have heard they will be blessed by God in what they do (v. 25). Similarly, Jesus emphasised the principle of hearing and doing. He said, Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. (Matthew 7:24) The essence of hearing the Word of God is to apply it to our daily lives because it gives a true picture of the spiritual state of the person just as a mirror shows how someone looks like physically. But if we hear the Word of God without practising it, we can be compared tosomeone who looks at him \/herself in a mirror without making necessary adjustments and such people live in self-deception (v. 22). The lesson is a reminder of the benefits of the Word of God, which serves the purposes of teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in order to produce pure and righteous believers (Psalm 119:9; 2 Timothy 3:16). It will achieve these purposes only when its principles are applied by the hearers. Verse 25 affirms that those who live according to the Word of God shall be blessed (Deuteronomy 28:1-1-2).

Encouragement to Practise True and Pure Religion James 1:26-27 Among the many godly virtues James encouraged his recipients to practise was true and pure religion. Religion, as it is used in the passage, refers to outward acts of service like fasting, giving to the needy, praying and general worship. He explained this clearly in verses 26 and 27. He said, If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless. He concluded his words of encouragement with detailed explanation of the meaning of pure and true religion that please God. According to him, pure religion is all about showing hospitality to orphans, widows, those in distress and to refrain from being polluted by the filth the world. According to the Old Testament order, it is certain that among those whom God will judge are those who take advantage of widows and orphans. Probably, there were some who believed they were practising true religion, who James made to understand that there is a relationship between beliefs and behaviours. The command to Christians to care for the underprivileged is an Old Testament law. Anyone who is truly religious will demonstrate it by careful speech and care for the needy (Malachi 3:5). The tongue is an essential part of human body. It tells more about ones state of spirituality and it also possesses the ability to make or mar the testimony of believers. Unless we control what we say, our outward activities: like being dutiful and pious are considered worthless (fruitless). On the other hand, those who cannot control their tongues ridicule themselves and their faith in Christ; hence the caution to be careful of its usage. Furthermore, James stressed total abstinence from the corruption of this sinful world. It is, therefore, apparent that Gods emphasis is not on religious activities but on right living<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1.

Therefore, if we must grow, we must put our faith to work so that we can be fruitful. The things we do not see usually influence and affect the things we see. For instance, although we do not see the air we breathe, it definitely affects our lives. In like manner, there is usually a relationship between what a person does and what he or she believes. The good works we see or do not see often reveal what is going on inside the person we are observing. Consider this: when a plant is dead, it can neither produce flowers nor fruits. But when the plant is alive and healthy, it produces something. So, as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead. The lesson we are studying today is about faith and works. It stresses the fact that there is a relationship between what a person believes (faith) and how a person behaves (works). Simply put, it aims at exploring the necessity for the believers to prove their faith through their actions. James wrote to encourage his readers to prove their faith by their works. In other words, they were to show that faith without works is useless (James 2:20).<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Encouragement to Express True Faith James 2:14-17 Seeing the need for equality among believers, there was a shift when James used the phrase my brothers in verse 14. He introduced this verse with a rhetorical question, What good is it ... if a man claims to have faith but also has no deeds, can such faith save? The emphasis of James in this passage is not on the meaning of faith but the result of faith. In other words, who we are and what we do as a result of the faith we profess are the true reflection of our faith. Worthy of note is the rhetorical question that followed a hypothetical case; Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to him, Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed, but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? (vv. 15-16) Can such faith save? Of course, a negative answer is anticipated because merely claiming to have faith is not enough; rather, our works of kindness should prove the genuineness of our faith. Unfortunately, we have some people in our churches today who claim they have faith but the fruits of their faith is not evident. Those who simply tell others that they are Christians, yet are indifferent toward meeting the needs of others have failed the test of true faith that James has described in the passage. Faith is an important virtue in the Christian race. According to James, faith that is devoid of works is dead. It is an underlying factor through which a believer becomes a member of the kingdom of God. The appropriation of the sacrificial roles Christ played in possessing salvation for humankind is only possible through faith. The benefit of salvation is accrued to humankind only by faith (John 3:16; Hebrews 11:6). No one is saved by his \/her works but by his \/her faith in Christ Jesus. Therefore, faith is worthless if it only exists in saying and not in doing. Furthermore, if nothing is done to satisfy the pressing needs of the poor and needy around us, what good is it? Therefore, the mandate to express true faith in good works is relevant to believers of all ages because the display of faith only by mere words contradicts the injunction of the Scriptures; hence such faith is considered dead.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

Verse 18 can best be described as question and answer section and perhaps the most misunderstood verse of the entire book. But someone will say, You have faith; I have deeds. Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do. A careful reading of this verse shows that James did not argue that works must be added to faith, but that genuine faith will inevitably be characterised by good works. This is important to note because good works are the evidence of faith. James believed that it is foolishness to reduce faith to a mere acknowledgment of the existence of God. This is because even demons believe that there is only one God (v. 19). A careful study of the passage reveals that James insisted that a saving faith is a living faith that proves its genuineness by what it does. However, it will be a misconception to assume that the purpose of James admonition was simply to stress the importance of good works over faith. He was essentially concerned about true faith that is expressed by good deeds to people around us. Therefore, believers should strive always to prove and develop their faith by acting it out like the examples of Abraham and Rahab. Abraham exemplified faith that works as he totally obeyed the instruction of God that he should offer his only son as a sacrifice to God. Rahab also proved her faith through the hospitality she showed to the two spies Joshua sent to Jericho.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1. Distinguish between Faith without works and faith with works. 2. What are the works that James refers to as the proof of faith?<\/p>\r\n","lesson3":"<p>C. Examples of True Faith James 2:21-26 As James concluded his discussion on faith and actions, he gave two biblical examples of those who demonstrated true faith. For instance, Abraham was considered righteous for offering his son, Isaac on the altar (v. 21; Genesis 22:12). Rahab was made right with God by her actions when she showed hospitality to the Israelite spies and helped them to escape (Joshua 2:1-21). In addition, James said that it is by peoples obedience or actions taken to honour God that they can be made right with God and not by what they think or say about God (v. 24). Although, it seems, that this is often seen as opposite to Pauls statement that Abrahams faith, not his works, caused God to declare him righteous and a friend of God (Romans 4:1-5). Consequently, James and Paul quoted the same passage Genesis 15:6 to prove their points. While Paul made it clear that Abraham was justified by faith in his response to Gods call to sacrifice Isaac as a burnt offering (Genesis 22:1-19), James believed that Abraham was justified by faith, which was evident in what he did. By implication, faith and works complement each other and can be likened to the body and spirit. Christians can be described as examples of faith when we are involved in the works of kindness to people around us, based on our faith in Jesus Christ.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1.

One evening after church service, she disclosed her intention to her pastor and after thorough investigation, her pastor discovered that although the man was actually ruthless, the woman too lacked control over the use of her tongue, whenever they had misunderstanding. Having prayed and was convinced by the Holy Spirit, the pastor counselled the woman to put a piece of bitter cola in her mouth whenever her husband was furious and about to beat her. Interestingly, the woman complied and the next time her husband was about to beat her, she could not say anything because of the piece of bitter kola in her mouth. By keeping silent, her husband had no reason to beat her. Soon, she discovered the secret and benefits of controlling her tongue. Another yardstick for spiritual maturity is believers speech. James devoted a portion of his letter to address the proper use of the tongue. He appealed, however, to people not only to control their speeches but also their thoughts (James 3:13-17). He emphasised that good words, not bad words, are beneficial to humankind and the entire creation.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Power in the Tongue James 3:1-5 James letter dealt with a variety of issues, especially the use of the tongue and teaching as a ministry. His statement in verse 1 indicates that some of the Jewish Christians were anxious to become teachers of the Word of God probably for show-off (John 3:10; 9:40-41). He warned that those who teach must understand their responsibility because they will be judged more strictly. He said, Not many of you should presume to be teachers, my brothers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly. By implication, a teachers condemnation will be greater because having professed to have a clear knowledge of the Word, he \/she is bound to obey it. On the issue of the proper use of the tongue, James used some figurative words to illustrate his instructions. In verses 4 and 5, he compared the tongue to a horses bit, a ships rudder and the small spark, which is capable of consuming an entire forest. It means that the tongue, though small, controls the whole body. The admonition, therefore, is that anyone who is able to tame his tongue can govern or have control over his \/her entire body as he \/she who holds a bridle controls a horse (v. 5). James warning in this passage is in connection with his previous warning that anyone who cannot control his \/her tongue practises worthless religion and deceives him \/herself. However, it should be noted that James warning is not to scare intending teachers of the Word of God but a charge to be diligent and not engage in the ministry possibly for personal gratification. This is similar to Pauls warning to Timothy that teachers should teach the Word of God rightly (2 Timothy 2:15). Therefore, those who desire the noble ministry of teaching should be careful to match their words with their actions so as to avert Gods judgement on them.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

The Perverse Nature of the Tongue James 3:6-8 Having explained the power of the tongue as illustrated and compared to horses bridle and a ships rudder, James again described the perverse nature of the tongue and likened it to fire. When it is set on fire or wrongly used, there are usually two results: \u00b7 It defiles the entire body. This is in line with Jesus explanation that it is not what goes into a mans mouth that defiles him, but that which comes out of a man (Matthew 15:11). In other words, the words we utter are indicative of what we are on the inside. \u00b7 It sets on fire the course of ones life. Even though the words we speak are invisible, once spoken, they affect almost everything around us. Even though humankind can, and have tamed other creatures (wild animals and domestic ones), James rightly observed that the tongue is evil and uncontrollable, humanly speaking. Invariably, if the tongue could be controlled, the whole body could be tamed as well. The tongue is a small unit of the body, yet it is one of the most powerful parts of the body. From the passage, James feels strongly concerned about the use of the tongue because out of the same mouth can come blessing and cursing. Unfortunately, most Christians have not fully comprehended or realised the awesome power that is available to us through our words and use of the tongue. Words have the potential of destroying people and societies. Many have been hurt by words spoken about them in secret, which have devastated them. Record has it that most of the African wars were as a result of misuse of words. To corroborate this, King Solomon said, Put away perversity from your mouth; keep corrupt talk far from your lips. (Proverbs 4:24) The summary of the lesson is that Christians should learn to use their tongues appropriately for the blessing of humankind and the glorification of God. We should guide our tongues and watch what comes out of our mouths. The admonition is important because the tongue can be an agent of the progress to the body of Christ if they are rightly used, but agents of destruction if carelessly used.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

The Tongue: A Blessing or a Curse James 3:9-12 In continuation of his teaching on the right use of the tongue, James identifies two __ ways people use their tongues to praise and to curse. James carefully made a comparison between the right and wrong uses of the tongue. He said, With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in Gods likeness. (v. 9) In other words, James means that blessing and curses ought not to proceed from the same mouth. According to him, just as fresh water and salt water cannot come from the same spring; the fig tree cannot bear olive; and grave vine cannot bear figs. Therefore, believers in Christ should not use their tongues to bless God and at the same time curse other people. The fact that humankind is made in the image and likeness of God should spur us to abstain from the wrong use of the tongue. Our tongues should not be a means through which other people are destroyed; rather, we use them to build other people up. Unfortunately, while some people sing praises to God, they also curse those who offend them with the same mouth. In his letter to the church in Ephesus, Paul warned against the use of harmful words (Ephesians 4:29).

The earthly wisdom is often associated with pride, tricks, envy, selfish ambition and satanic intrigues. people with earthly wisdom do things without the consciousness of Gods gift and the promise of eternity. But the godly wisdom is characterised with the fear of God, fairness and love for humanity. It is assumed that all that love and fear God operate under godly wisdom, while people who lack the fear of God are dominated with earthly wisdom. Unfortunately, those who possess the earthly wisdom are increasing daily because of the increase in knowledge in the world today. The world of information and communication technology (ICT) has made almost everyone wise in their own eyes. There is competition on who is the wisest and strongest among nations of the world and this has caused wars and troubles. In todays text, James addresses the matter of wisdom. He contrasts seven characteristics of human wisdom with seven qualities of divinely inspired wisdom. He, therefore, admonished Christians to shun earthly or devilish wisdom, but embrace heavenly or godly wisdom. This is in line with Jobs confession. He said, And he said to man, The fear of the Lord \u2014 that is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding. (Job 28:28) Heavenly or godly wisdom and its characteristics have power to dispel earthly or devilish wisdom and its characteristics just as light dispels darkness. Believers should embrace godly wisdom rather than earthly wisdom, which is for self-gratification.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. The Heavenly and Earthly Wisdom Compared James 3:13-18 James started by an admonition to his readers to prove their wisdom and understanding through exhibiting good life and deeds in the humility that comes from wisdom. Thereafter, he listed the characteristics of earthly wisdom as the harbour of bitterness, envy and selfish ambition, disorder and every evil practice. According to verse 15, he affirmed that such wisdom originates from the Devil thus it is unspiritual. Therefore, the people who exhibit the characteristics of earthly wisdom but call it godly or heavenly wisdom are practising empty, boastful religion and are lying against the truth. He refuted their lies and called their wisdom earthly, demonic, and sensual. But the wisdom that comes from God is humble, pure, peaceloving, submissive, merciful; it bears good fruit, and relies on Gods leadership and guidance. More so, it is impartial and sincere. These verses show the differences between humans pretending to be wise and their being really wise. From the passage, it is obvious that earthly and godly wisdom have different sources and characteristics. James, therefore, advocated that his recipients should prove their type of wisdom by their conduct or good works, which is done with complete humility and meekness. Apostle Paul also advocated the need to exhibit heavenly or godly wisdom in his letter to the church in Corinth when he stated, ...Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. Apostle Paul affirmed that God has rendered foolish the wisdom of this world (1 Corinthians 1:20, 24b). Since humility in the Bible signifies total dependence God and fear of the Lord means absolute obedience to God and His reign, therefore, the true biblical meaning of heavenly or godly wisdom is total dependence and absolute obedience to God through Jesus Christ. James then listed the characteristics of heavenly wisdom as purity, peaceable, willingness to yield, full of mercy, good fruits and impartiality. James concluded that this godly wisdom causes peacemakers to sow the fruit of righteousness in peace. These characteristics are comparable to the fruit of the Holy Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23).<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

Heavenly Wisdom and Patience in Suffering James 5:7-12 As James concludes his letter; he admonished his readers to exhibit godly wisdom in time of suffering. He said, Be patient, then, brothers, until the Lords coming .... (v. 7b) In other words, believers are to look forward patiently to the Lords return, even in the midst of persecution. He illustrated his messages with the farmer who waits patiently for the autumn and spring rain, with endurance until he reaps his crops. In verse 8, he repeated the need to be patient and stand firm because the second coming of Christ is near when true believers will be raptured and reign with Christ in His kingdom. He, however, sounded a note of warning against grumbling so as to escape being judged. He called on believers to receive encouragement from the prophets of old who endured persecutions and remained faithful until the end, using Job as an example. He endured suffering, even though he was described as righteous and blameless, yet because he endured, his end was more glorious than his beginning (Job 42:12-16). God remains compassionate and merciful to help believers in times of suffering (v. 11c), and to be consistent in their speaking the truths so that it becomes unnecessary to swear when speaking. They are to do this to escape condemnation. James admonition to his readers to endure suffering is also applicable to contemporary Christians, especially these days when there is severe persecution of Christians. Our hope should lie on the fact that the present suffering cannot be compared with the glory that shall be revealed at the end of age (Romans 8:18). Therefore, we should continue to endure suffering. until Jesus return. We should not murmur against God or one another.

It is often assumed that some parents may have noticed some signs of competition among their children at one time or the other. Sometimes, it results to hostility, which is referred to as sibling rivalry. Different factors may be responsible for this, these include birth order, success, intellectual giftedness, personality traits, beauty, and so on. Rivalry among siblings becomes intense, especially in a polygamous family and when there is parental preferential treatments. Because of the consequences which are usually devastating, in most cases, such attitude like jealousy and lack of love in the family can lead to animosity, which sometimes extends to their adulthood and their children. What started as mere competition for food or parental attention may end up in siblings killing one another, if it is not nipped in the bud. The Bible, especially the Old Testament has records of examples of sibling rivalry. Cain was jealous of his brother Abel because God preferred Abels offering to his and this led to murder. Rachael and Leah competed for the love of their husband, __ Jacob, even Isaac and Ishmael (Genesis 29:31 30:24; 21:8-9). Also, Miriam and Aaron, probably out of jealousy, challenged the authority of their brother, Moses (Numbers 12). In all these instances, the root of the problem can be traced to lack of love for one another. Todays lesson centres on the story of Joseph who was hated by his brothers, and what rivalry can breed among siblings when love is lost in the family.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Joseph, the Fathers Loved Son Genesis 37:2-4 Jacob lived in the land of Canaan where his father had stayed and was later buried (Genesis 49:29-30). He had twelve sons but he loved Joseph more than his brothers for obvious reasons. According to verse 3, he was born to his father Jacob in his old age and probably because he is the son of his favourite wife. To further prove his love for him, Jacob made a rich ornament robe with full sleeves for him. Without doubt, the provision of such expensive robe showed Jacobs intention to favour him more than his brothers, and to spare him from taking part in their menial labour. Jacobs preference for Joseph triggered hatred from his brothers and they expressed it by refusing to speak kind words to him from that moment (v. 4). At the age of seventeen, Joseph became a shepherd and took care of his fathers flock in the field with his brothers, sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his fathers wives.Sometimes, it is difficult to break old patterns. Jacob repeated the same favouritism that his mother Rebecca showed to him, which eventually sparked a similar hatred and fury in Esau, his twin brother who was preferred by their father. Ordinarily, one would have expected Jacob to learn from his past mistake and manage his family differently without necessarily showing partiality in his love towards his children. However, he maintained the old pattern of showing favouritism to Joseph to the detriment of others. Being a parent is an opportunity, __ and a great responsibility of providing for the needs of our children with the expectation of loving them equally. Another important role of parents is to maintain balance and curtail some excesses on the part of their children because any slight indication of parental favouritism will definitely result in hatred and disunity in the family, even death in some cases.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

Joseph and His Dreams Genesis 37:5-11 Joseph was divinely ordained to be great and nothing would change it, as it was revealed to him. He had a dream that they (his parents and brothers) were in the field binding sheaves when suddenly his sheaf arose and stood upright and theirs bowed down to his (vv. 6-7). By interpretation, it means he would reign over his brothers someday. Probably out of enthusiasm or immaturity, Joseph shared the dream with his brothers and that triggered more anger and jealousy already in them. They said to him, Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us? (v. 8) They hated him and became more jealous of him. The second dream was a replica of the first, when the sun, moon and the eleven stars were bowing to him. Innocently, he shared it with his brothers without any premonition of their evil intention. Although his father rebuked him about being careless with his dreams. That, however, would not have stopped his brothers from openly showing that they hated him. After all, their fathers preferential treatment from the beginning had already triggered a cycle of hatred and jealousy, which could not be reversed.This lesson is an indicator to some causes of rivalry and jealousy among children of the same parents. Actually, it was not Josephs fault that his father loved and preferred him to his brothers, since his brothers could not openly show their dissatisfaction to their father, possibly out of respect, Joseph became the object of their anger and frustrations. The situation in the family degenerated without any attempt of their father to reconcile his children. Parents should be proactive to intervene in the affairs of their children immediately they notice hatred, jealousy and division in the home, instead of love and unity. This is important because negative emotions aggravate crisis in the family more than one can imagine, if left unchecked. It is, therefore, the duty of parents to make sure that their children do not develop negative emotions. Instead, they should be encouraged to love one another as God loves them.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1. Should Joseph be blamed for sharing his dreams with his brothers?

Josephs Brothers Cruelty Genesis 37:23-24a, 28 Josephs brothers had gone to graze their fathers flock near Shechem and their father decided to send Joseph to them to ask of their welfare (vv. 12-14). Joseph sincerely accepted the assignment, went after his brothers and found them near Dothan. Of course, it was an opportunity for his brothers to carry out their conceived evil against him. Following the suggestion of Reuben who was actually concerned about preventing him from being killed (vv. 18-22). They stripped him of his rich ornamented robe and threw him into an empty cistern probably with the assumption that that was his end. Soon after, he was sold to the Ishmaelite merchants for twenty shekels of silver and was taken to the land of Egypt as a slave boy (v. 28). The common saying that it takes a little spark to set the whole forest ablaze is very true in this scenario. Josephs brothers sold him for a token, without affection for him as their brother. When jealousy and hatred are allowed to foster among siblings, friends, couples and even colleagues, they grow and there is the temptation to do the unimaginable. It is sinful to hate and be jealous of one another. Jesus said, But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment.... (Matthew 5:22) To corroborate the importance of loving one another Paul said, Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. (Romans 12:14) Christians should strive to live in peace and love with one another and eschew bitterness against anyone, no matter the offence, before the situation degenerates to the point of considering the option of murder.

While some  people may have had everything on a platter of gold, the story of others is nothing near fun. Some started as orphans, insignificant people and others started from underneath and by the grace of God, they were able to make it to the top. There is a common saying that delay is not denial. This proverb fits well into the experiences of Joseph, right from the time his brothers sold him into slavery because of their hatred for him and the time he spent in prison. When he was sold and later imprisoned due to false allegation, his future looked bleak. However, while he was in prison, he met Pharaohs cupbearer who eventually became an instrument to fulfil Gods purpose for his life. While Joseph was waiting and trusting God for intervention, he did not fail to use his gifts to assist others. His ability, through the wisdom of God, to interpret dreams earned him favour in the sight of King Pharaoh. At last, he was rewarded for his obedience and faithfulness, and he was put in charge of the whole of Egypt. The lesson of today focuses on how God rewarded Josephs obedience by bringing His plan for Josephs life to come to pass. This lesson is a pointer that delay is not denial and it teaches the virtues of patience, obedience, and most importantly the need to use our gifts, no matter the circumstances we find ourselves.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Joseph Interprets the Kings Dream Genesis 41:25-33 God has a way of making His purpose in the life of humankind come to pass as it is seen in the story of Joseph. Pharaoh had dreams that troubled his mind, which made him seek for interpretation. Upon the recommendation of his cupbearer whom Joseph had earlier interpreted his dream while in prison, he was hurriedly brought out of the prison to the palace of King Pharaoh to interpret the kings dreadful dreams. According to verse 25, Joseph wisely and skilfully interpreted the dreams to mean impending severe famine in the land of Egypt that will last for seven years, though there will be seven years of abundance before the seven years of famine. Having interpreted the dream, Joseph also proffered a solution to the impending famine. He said to Pharaoh, And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt. Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.(vv. 33-34) Joseph revealed that the revelation has been decided by God and He will __ accomplish it soon. The same dream was repeated twice an indication that such a divine revelation was for the sake of emphasis. Joseph successfully interpreted the dreams with the help of the Holy Spirit and the king was convinced of its true meaning. It is worth mentioning that Joseph identified his gift to interpret dreams and he used it to the glory of God and the benefit of others. He used it while he was in prison without hesitation or demanding for payment as it is the practice of some people today who demand for compensation before they use their gifts in the church. However, little did Joseph know that his faithfulness was a pathway to fulfilling his dream. Eventually, he was brought before King Pharaoh and with Gods wisdom and grace, he rightly interpreted the dreams and suggested a perfect solution. The Scripture is true that the gift of a man makes way for him. Christians should endeavour to identify their areas of giftedness through prayers, meditation, godly counsel and encouragement and use them to glorify God and for the benefit of humankind without expecting a reward. When this is done faithfully and consistently, surely Gods reward will come and you will be glad.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

Joseph Is Promoted Genesis 41:37-40, 50-52 Josephs interpretation of Pharaohs dreams and the suggested plan of action to avert the impending famine in Egypt seemed good to Pharaoh and his officials. Thus the king decided to put him in charge of his palace and the whole of Egypt (vv. 39- 41). The king promoted Joseph and he became the number two citizen in a foreign land. To authenticate the promotion, the king removed his signet ring and wore it on Josephs finger. He wore him a robe and a gold chain to show that Joseph is officially empowered to act in his capacity. This was followed by a royal procession with the proclamation, Make way for the second in command to the king. Pharaoh himself made a royal declaration in verse 44, I am Pharaoh, but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt. This implies that all the people of Egypt must acknowledge Joseph and his new appointment, as the second in command to the king. The climax of the ceremony was the change of his name to an Egyptian name Zaphenah-Paneah. He was also given an Egyptian wife (v. 45), to complement his new position. The names of his two sons are Manasseh which means God has made me to forget all my hardship(v. 51a), and Ephraim which means God has made me fruitful (v. 52b). These names summed up Josephs experiences and attitude to all the hurts he suffered in the past. The story of Joseph is an attestation that no one can thwart Gods plan for His children. Joseph who was once hated, and rejected by his brothers became elevated to a position of authority in a foreign land. God probably took him through his experiences to test his patience, resilience, obedience and to develop his character and capacity for the position. Interestingly, he passed the test and God rewarded him with an exalted position. His policy of storing grain from the field during the first seven years of abundance ensured fair distribution and access to food for the whole community and beyond (vv. 47-49). The life of Joseph, from the time he had his dreams to the time he became the second in command in Egypt, is an affirmation that God sees and rewards obedience and faithfulness. Even today, God still rewards people for their obedience both spiritually and physically.

For Adams, this will help him to fulfil his dream of becoming a medical doctor. Unfortunately, this never came to pass. Apart from the fact that Adams was denied the opportunity of attending school, he became a sales boy in one of his uncles shops while his cousins attended the best school in town. He was made to do all the house chores and sometimes he was deprived food and proper care. One day, Adams ran away from the home without anyone knowing of his whereabouts. He began to sleep under the bridge until he met a pastor who willingly accommodated him, cared for him and promised to train him to the university. In fact, Adams enjoyed the necessary care and education through the pastor. After his graduation as a medical doctor, he got employed at a Federal Medical Centre. One day, his uncle walked into the hospital and was directed to be attended to by Doctor Adams. Immediately the old man entered his office, Adams recognised him. He treated him with courtesy and paid for his medications. When the old man inquired why the doctor was so generous, he smiled and introduced himself as his son, Adams. Haunted with shame, the old man broke down in tears and held him to himself begging for forgiveness. The story above is similar to the case of Joseph and his brothers who were haunted by shame when they finally realised that their supposed dead brother was alive, and occupying an exalted position in a foreign land. The whole story shows that God was always in charge, such that good came out of the evil that the brothers of Joseph had committed against him. The burden and shame of past sins and failures are issues that many Christians contend with silently. This is the situation that Josephs brothers found themselves. They were troubled by the shame of their past misdeeds. The lesson focuses on the burden and shame Josephs brothers faced when Joseph revealed himself to them as the second in command in the land of Egypt.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Joseph Recognises His Brothers Genesis 42:6-17 According to Josephs interpretation of Pharaohs dreams, the seven years of plenty was gone and the other seven years of famine had just begun. As recommended by Joseph, there was enough food throughout Egypt but there was severe famine in other countries that people came from all over the world to buy food from Egypt (Genesis 41:57). When Jacob learnt that there was food in Egypt, he immediately told his sons to go and buy but Benjamin was left behind because he did not want to risk his life (vv. 3-4). Behold, Josephs dream was fulfilled when his brothers bowed down before him with their heads to the ground as courtesy demands. Immediately, Joseph recognised them but they did not recognise him probably because of his new appearance and they never expected him to be alive, let alone occupy such an exalted position. Besides, it was almost two decades they separated and he spoke an Egyptian language through an interpreter. According to verse 9, Joseph remembered his dreams and in pretense, he accused them falsely as if they were spies. Despite their explanation in verses 10-13, they were all kept in prison custody for three days. The only condition for their release was to keep Simon behind so that others will go and bring their youngest brother (Benjamin) to prove their sincerity. Benjamin is significant in the account because he was Josephs full brother. Josephs unfriendly attitude toward his brothers was not with the intention to revenge for their wrongdoing. It was to bring to pass the accomplishment of his dreams and to have an update of the state of his family, which he desired to know. It is, therefore, important for believers to be careful with how they treat others because every action we take, whether good or bad has its own consequences. Josephs brothers never expected that they would see him again, not even in such an exalted position. Our daily relationship with people within and outside the church leaves some memories with them. It can be played back someday in the future because human minds have the capacity to recollect good and bad experiences, no matter how long ago it took place.

Ultimately, he agreed to release them on two conditions: \u00b7 Firstly, one of them will remain in prison while the others will go and take grains for their starving household. \u00b7 Secondly, they must bring their youngest brother who they had told him was with their father so as to prove their sincere journey (v. 16). They blamed one another and regarded their present suffering as punishment for the sins they committed against their brother, Joseph. But Reuben replied, Didnt I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldnt listen! Now we must give an accounting for his blood. (v. 22) Unfortunately, they did not know Joseph could understand them since he communicated to them through an interpreter. When he heard this, he was moved with emotion and turned aside to weep. He, however, seized Simon and gave an order to fill their sack with grains with their money in their sack. He also made provisions for their journey back home because of the power Pharaoh had bestowed on him (Genesis 41:44). Josephs brothers confession in verse 21 is an indication that guilt produces shame and it haunts, even though it may appear to have been forgotten. The Scripture says, He who conceals his sins does not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy. (Proverbs 28:13) Josephs brothers covered up the matter for many years thinking that it was a forgotten issue until their encounter in Egypt that caused them to remember how they treated Joseph wickedly. They quickly interpreted the situation they found themselves as the consequence of their cruel actions toward their brother. Josephs generosity towards his brothers, despite the ill-treatment he suffered from them reminds us of our responsibility to do good to those who hate and maltreat us. Christians should constantly remember that one of the ways to overcome the tendency to revenge any act of wickedness is to remember Jesus teaching about our relationship with our enemies. According to Matthews account, He commanded us to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us so that we may be sons of our Father in heaven (Matthew 5:44-45a). The most challenging aspect of the story is that Joseph did not seek revenge; rather he showed his brothers genuine love and commanded that their bags be filled with enough food for the family and he also made provision for their safe trip back home.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

Having treated the old man with kindness and love, he revealed his identify to him as young Adams Uyi. Immediately, the old man broke down and wept bitterly. He remembered how he maltreated him and so never expected that the young man will make it in life. He, however, regretted his actions against him and begged for forgiveness. He blamed his wife and children for being responsible for everything because he was perceived as a competitor to their children. When the doctor was interviewed about what motivated him to treat the old man kindly, considering the way he was maltreated years ago, he simply said, God has chosen to promote me so that the wrongs can be made right at such a time as this. Above all, the love of Christ has prevailed over everything that happened in the past. Immediately, he made adequate provision for the old mans continuous health care including his general well-being. The story above is a replica of Josephs encounter with his brothers. Even though his brothers regretfully blamed one another for their wicked deed towards him, Joseph interpreted the scenario as Gods purpose to preserve a remnant of his family. It is common these days to see people using their positions and authority to take revenge. The focus of the lesson is how Joseph showed love to his brothers who had treated him cruelly.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Joseph Discloses His Identify Genesis 45:1-4 Joseph did not disclose his identity to his brothers immediately. Rather, he continued to speak harshly to them through an interpreter. Benjamin was eventually brought to Egypt, based on their previous agreement to prove their innocence that they are not spies but sincere people who came to buy food. Unfortunately, Benjamin was intentionally held captive because he was accused of stealing the rulers (Joseph) special silver cup (44:12-15). Genesis chapter 44:18-34 is a long plea by Judah with Joseph to release Benjamin and take himself captive instead. The appeal was based on the assurance of his return given to their aged father before he was released to go with them to Egypt. Noteworthy is his emotional statement in chapter 44:34. He said, I cannot bear to see this disaster come upon my father. When Joseph heard this, he was overwhelmed with emotion and wept loudly. He disclosed his true identity and said to them, I am Joseph! Is my father still living? They were not able to answer because they were terrified in his presence but he said to them, Come close to me, ... I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt! (v. 4) Indeed, it was a demonstration of his love for them, which has prevailed over everything they had done to him in the past. The most challenging point in this passage is the fact that Joseph did not seek revenge; rather, he showed love to his brothers who once treated him cruelly. Therefore, it is most likely that he was motivated to show love to his brothers with the understanding that God only allowed all the challenges for the fulfilment of His will for His people. Supposedly, God was in charge and used the brothers evil deed for good purposes. In addition, he would have seen his brothers attitude from being cruel to being concerned, especially the way they pleaded for Benjamin and the concern they had for their father (44:16-34). His revelation of his true identity and the intense private interview that followed was the beginning of the process of forgiveness and reconciliation. Instead of reacting with pride, anger and revenge, he wept in humility and showed them love (Genesis 42:24; 43:30). Josephs enduring love for his brothers is aptly described in Apostle Pauls definition of love (1 Corinthians 13:4-7). A true disciple of Christ will not keep a grudge forever because such attitude is contrary to the Spirit of God. Even if our human nature wants us to seek revenge, Jesus love and forgiveness towards us should propel us to love one another, no matter the gravity of the wrongdoing.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1. Joseph forgave his brothers for their wickedness. Discuss what you would have done if you were Joseph. 2. Was it fair for Joseph to have kept his brothers in suspense for that long? if you were him what would you have done differently? 3. What will you do to those who have hurt you after this lesson?<\/p>\r\n","lesson2":"<p>B. Joseph Explains Gods Purpose Genesis 45:5-8 The story of Joseph and his brothers has remained exemplary in the history of humankind. After disclosing his identity, he encouraged them not to be distressed or angry with themselves for selling him. He explained that everything that had happened was according to the workings of God in order to save lives because of the famine in the land. He said in verse 7, But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.Therefore, it was not his brothers who sent him but God who has made him a father to Pharaoh, the lord of his entire household and ruler over the land of Egypt (v. 8). It is interesting to note that Joseph did not see himself as someone who was sold into slavery but as a saviour who was sent ahead for the good of his people. This was actualised when Jacob and the entire family lived and prospered in the land of Egypt through the influence of Joseph (Genesis 47:27). The most exciting aspect of Josephs story is that he encouraged his brothers not to be troubled over their ill-treatment of him but he gave credit to God for fulfilling His purpose for his life. This of course is another proof of his love for them. Without doubt, his explanation would have calmed his brothers fears, and made them gain better understanding about Gods workings in the lives of His people. Perhaps they thought they had succeeded in destroying him and his dreams, not realising that they only helped him to fulfil his dreams. God reversed their negative actions to positive that ultimately benefited the whole family, thereby preserving the seeds that will become a nation. In fact, Josephs enduring love for his brothers prefigures Jesus Christ, the beloved of His Father (Matthew 3:17). He who was rejected by His family (Mark 3:21), rose to an exalted position (Philippians 2:10), and finally brought salvation to the whole world through His suffering (John 3:16). Similarly, the story mirrors James observation that love and mercy are greater than judgment (James 2:13).<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1. Joseph triumphed because he resisted the desire to revenge. Suggest ways vengeance can be destructive both to the one seeking vengeance and the one against whom revenge is sought. 2. Sometimes, hard times can be blessings in disguise. Discuss, possibly with personal examples.<\/p>\r\n","lesson3":"<p>C. Josephs Plans for His Family Genesis 45:9-15 Joseph and his brothers finally reconciled and immediately, he gave a swift instruction to bring his father whom he had missed for a long time, to Egypt. He said, Now hurry back to my father and say to him, This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; dont delay. (v. 9) The same command for his father Jacob to come to Egypt quickly and see the honour accorded him in a strange land is repeated in verse 13. According to verse 10, provision was made for the entire family to relocate to Egypt including their animals to live in the region of Goshen without further delay. He committed himself to continue to sustain them throughout the period of the famine. He embraced Benjamin and they both wept. He kissed all his brothers, wept over them and they talked to one another freely (v. 15). These actions are Josephs proof of his genuine love and forgiveness for his brothers. Interestingly, the walls of hatred and suspicion that separated them for many years were broken down with the show of love and affection. The lifestyle of Joseph remains exemplary in human history. He recognised his promotion as the handiwork of God, which should benefit the entire family. His prompt response to relocate his family close to him shows the genuineness of his forgiveness and how much he cherished them. Also, rather than wait for the offender to first ask for forgiveness, he initiated the process of reconciliation by forgiving and accepting his brothers back, in spite of all that they did to him. Josephs action foreshadowed Jesus action of reconciling us back to God, even while we were still sinners (Romans 5:8), so that we can be reunited with God. The summary of the lesson is that Christians should endeavour to forgive their offenders, show love and affection to their families, whether biological or not and allow love to prevail over everything. When we do this then we will be able to bring down whatever wall that has separated us from others and begin to live as one big family.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1.

They both attended the same primary and  secondary schools. Some years later, James father won an election as the Local Government Chairman and immediately relocated to the Headquarters with his family, for easy administration. After his National Youth Service Corp, John decided to stay with the family of James while in search of a job. While he was waiting to get a good job, he decided to engage himself in some menial jobs and contracts but James depended solely on his parents for his upkeep. He was always busy with his phone, using internet and playing games. For months, John continued with his hard work and resilience with the hope of making it, especially as the first son of his family who had other dependants. He found favour in the sight of God and soon, he got a car and an apartment within James neighbourhood. However, his relationship with James was not affected in any way except James father who suddenly became jealous and hated John with passion. He made several attempts to implicate him but God intervened and he was exonerated. The last attempt was to assassinate him but James warned his father against such wicked act and eventually revealed the secret to his friend, John. Todays lesson focuses on the love and devotion that existed between Jonathan, the son of King Saul and David, the anointed king. Ordinarily, Jonathan would have supported the evil plan of his father to kill David, as the heir to the throne but he played the role of a mediator between his father and his friend, David because of his love for him. He opposed the unjust intentions of his father, King Saul, in order to offer support and protection to David, his beloved friend.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Sauls Plan to Kill David 1 Samuel 19:1-3 Chapter 16 of 1 Samuel has the record of how Samuel anointed David and how he entered into Sauls service. The hatred Saul had for David began when he (David) was celebrated for his victory over the Philistines. Since then, Saul became jealous of David and made several attempts to kill him (1 Samuel 18:6-9, 11, 22, 29). However, everything David did was successful because the Lord was with him. According to verse 1 of chapter 19, Saul told his son Jonathan and all the officials to kill David because of his continued hatred for him. But because Jonathan was fond of David and probably remembered the covenant of love and devotion he had made with him (1 Samuel 18:3), he refrained from carrying out the command. He revealed the secret to David and said, ...My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard tomorrow morning; go into hiding and stay there. I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are. Ill speak to him about you and will tell you what I find out.(vv. 2-3) The voice of Jonathan in these verses is best described as the voice of a loving and devoted friend who played the role of a mediator between two __ opposing parties this is noteworthy. He worked against his fathers plan to kill David, not minding the consequences of his action. Sometimes, the success of people, their skilfulness, experience and competence could lead to hatred, animosity and finally the plan to kill and destroy such persons. Such was the case of Saul. His animosity toward David was rooted in fear and jealousy. The public admiration of David after the confrontation with Goliath seems to have initiated it over the years (1 Samuel 18:6-9). Sauls attempts to kill David were made futile by the actions of his own son, Jonathan. He was willing to reveal his fathers secret plan to David. Although Saul knew his servants were loyal to David and his son loved David; however, he thought he could manipulate them to kill him. Finally, Saul himself was overcome by the spirit of God, and he was unable to harm David (vv. 23-24). Even though we live in a wicked world, those who have faith in God will ever remain under the protective arm of the almighty God. Nevertheless, the love between Jonathan and David remains a model to Christians of all ages to always promote love and not hatred among people.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

Jonathans Wise Counsel 1 Samuel 19:4-7 Jonathans determination to keep the covenant of peace and love with David was genuinely demonstrated. Based on his advice to David to be on guard when he meets his father in verse 2, he truly gave a positive report and testimony about him. He said to his father, ... Let not the king do wrong to his servant David; he has not wronged you, and what he has done has benefited you greatly.(v. 4) Specifically in verse 5, he made reference to Davids great achievements when he risked his life to confront Goliath (the Philistine). He killed him, thereby winning victory for Israel instead of shame. He testified that the victory made Saul glad. He asked a rhetorical question why his father would do wrong to an innocent man like David for no reasonable cause? He described David as his fathers servant, an innocent man and a son who does not deserve death, as planned by his father, Saul. Interestingly, Saul listened to Jonathans plea and changed his mind. This is contrary to what is seen today in some homes where some parents feel insulted and restrain their children from discussing sensitive issues with them. The aftermath of Jonathans discussion with his father, Saul made him resolve not to kill David and he even made a covenant in the name of the Lord (v. 6). According to verse 7, having intimated David of his fathers resolution not to kill him, the relationship between Saul and David was restored and he continued to serve the king as before. Jonathans love and devotion to his friend David is exceptional. Despite the fact that his father Saul hated and wanted David dead, yet he talked so well of him to Saul that he put himself under an oath not to do any harm to David. Jonathans mediatory role exemplifies the role of Christians in reconciling and bringing peace to opposition parties instead of being judgmental and causing more harm. Jonathan had a different opinion about David. He saw him as a friend to be loved and protected from harm, a gallant soldier and a faithful servant of his father. He recognised the victory he won for Israel that brought fame to them. David was actually a man of valour and courage who was faithful to the king and to the nation of Israel.

She is the secretary of the Women Missionary Union (W.M.U) in her church. She looks pious but actually she is known to be troublesome and keeps malice at the slightest disagreement with people. One day, she had a quarrel with her neighbour and publicly, she declared that the woman has become her enemy for life. Every attempt made by the woman to reconcile with her proved unsuccessful, even with the intervention of the president of the Women Missionary Union of her church. The hatred she had for the woman continued for months without her readiness to interact or reconcile with her. However, Mrs Victoria Owies neighbour never ceased to pray, do good, care for her children and tolerate insults from her. When she was interviewed about her interest and generosity towards Mrs Victoria and her family, despite the misunderstanding, she explained and made reference to Jesus teaching in the gospel according to Luke about loving our enemies as Christians. Later, her persistence in doing good to Mrs Victoria and her family members brought about reconciliation and peace began to reign again. Mrs Victoria testified about the spiritual maturity of her neighbour who ceaselessly demonstrated love and kindness toward her and her family, in spite of the fact that she had declared her her enemy for life. Oftentimes, we wonder how we should treat our enemies and how we should respond to them. Generally, the human nature in us would want us to retaliate and possibly cease from doing good to those who hate us and wish us evil. Jesus taught His disciples to love their enemies by forgiving them, responding to their needs, and by being non-judgmental. Our lesson today focuses on Jesus instructions regarding the principles of overcoming self-interest in the Christian community<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Instructions to Love Our Enemy Luke 6:27-31 Jesus spent adequate time to instruct His disciples about the kingdom mandate. Chapter 6 of the gospel of Luke has the record of instructions for His disciples including the command to love their enemies. According to this passage, Jesus explained in detail how to overcome self-interest and to love one another, even our enemies. First He said, But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. If someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic. (vv. 27-29) Furthermore, He commanded in verse 30 to give when anyone asks for something and never demand back when anyone takes what belongs to us. Thereafter, He emphasised the importance of the Golden Rule which says, Do to others as you would have them do to you. It simply means to overcome self-centredness. The command to love our enemies was also echoed by Paul in his letter to the church in Rome. He said, Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.(Romans 12:14) The enemies Jesus referred to in this passage are those who hate us, curse, maltreat, persecute and forcefully take what belongs to us because of our faith in the Lord Jesus. They can be likened to Boko Haram members, kidnappers and some other Muslim groups who go about killing Christians because of their faith in Jesus. In fact, the principle of loving our enemies is contrary to the understanding of the people of the world who believe in a tooth for a tooth and tit for tat. Jesus command to love our enemies is a call to overcome self-interest and a total change of life. A natural man cannot meet the requirements of loving their enemies and doing good to those who maltreat them without the tendency to retaliate. However, these instructions are for those who care to listen, obey Jesus teaching and those whose lives have been transformed. This explains the implication of Jesus statement to Nicodemus when He said, I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.(John 3:3) It should be noted that as important as it to is love our enemies, we should also not compromise our stand concerning evil or fail to confront it, whenever it is necessary so that we will not be judged.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1. Class members should discuss how much they will be willing to take risks in order to love their enemies. 2. Are there enemies that they can never love? Why or why not, according to the passage. 3. Is it right to rejoice when calamity befalls our enemies?<\/p>\r\n","lesson2":"<p>B. The Reward for Loving Our Enemies Luke 6:32-36 Jesus questions in verses 32-34 are indications that the command for His followers to love their enemies is mandatory. He made a comparison between the lives of sinners, which must be distinguished with good deeds by believers. He said, what will be our credit if we love, do good and lend to those who love us, and those from whom we expect repayment? Because sinners do likewise without expecting anything in form of gain. In other words, our actions and kindness must exceed the activities of sinners to attract rewards. Again, He repeated the command to love our enemies, do good to them and lend without expecting anything back (v. 35). Similarly, in Matthew chapter 5:42, Jesus said, When someone asks you for something, give it to him; when someone wants to borrow something, lend it to him. The reward of obeying the command to love our enemies is in twofold: there will be a great reward and we will be qualified to be called children of the Most High. He concluded with an admonition to be merciful, just as our Father is merciful. This command is no doubt the cure for selfish interest and self-centredness. There is always a reward for every action. Jesus did not only state our responsibilities to love our enemies, pray and care for them, meet their needs, He also stated the reward for obeying His command. It is the only way to confirm our claim that God is our Father; hence we are expected to live and act like Him. It is almost natural to reciprocate by loving those who love us and retaliate by hating those who hate us, but Jesus standard is that Christians are to love their perceived enemies. The command to be merciful is also important because it takes a merciful or compassionate person to do good, both to the ungrateful and the wicked just like God who allows the wicked to enjoy the rain and the sunshine.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

She is one of the faithful, respected and spiritually mature Christians in her church. She is regular, punctual during the preparatory classes and Sunday services and she encourages others to do same with the fear of God. Deaconess Abigail is gifted in teaching and as a result, many members always look forward to her creative ways of opening the session every Sunday. One rainy Sunday morning, while her family was on their way to church, they saw an accident victim by the roadside,. While Deaconess Abigail wanted the victim assisted to a nearby hospital, her husband was reluctant because of the fear of being accused falsely and their possible lateness for service. Her husband and their children hurriedly went to church but she waited and took care of the unknown wounded man who later identified himself as a pastor. Though her husband was part of the Sunday school service, he was not fulfilled because the topic for the day was Meeting the Needs of Others. One of the most popular parables Jesus told is the parable of the good Samaritan. Jesus told the parable to illustrate that a real neighbour is one who gives help whenever it is needed, even to strangers. The lesson is a reminder that when Christians allow the Holy Spirit to guide them in meeting the needs of other people, crimes will greatly reduce and Jesus will reign in the hearts of many people. Meeting the needs of others is the height of true spirituality.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. The Key to Eternal life Luke 10:25-28 During Jesus earthly ministry, the Pharisees and teachers of the law were constantly looking for an opportunity to accuse Him. On one occasion, a teacher of the law came to test Jesus ability as an interpreter of the Scriptures. Teacherhe said, What must I do to inherit eternal life?Interestingly, Jesus who is the Wisdom of God did not give any direct answer. Jesus simply asked two important questions What is written in the Law? he replied. How do you read it? (v. 26). The man replied, Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and love your neighbour as yourself. According to Jesus assessment in verse 27, the man answered correctly. Then Jesus told him, Do this and you will live. By implication, though it seems the man knew the law but he did not fully understand it as the key to eternal life. This can be likened to some Christians who read the Bible but lack the knowledge of the power of God in His Word. The principle of loving God and our neighbours as much as we love ourselves is the summation of the whole Law of Moses (Leviticus 19:18, 34; Deuteronomy 24:10-22), which Jesus referred to in this text. Basically, the command to love God and humankind is the key to inheriting eternal life. This happens when we accept Jesus as our Saviour and Lord and His love is imputed in our hearts. Gods law of love is the ultimate fulfilment of biblical law, including the Ten Commandments, as it fulfils the intent of such laws. Apostle Paul subscribed to this when he said, The entire law is summed up in a single command: Love your neighbour as yourself. (Galatians 5:14) Therefore, through Christs salvation and His law of love, Christians are released from the Mosaic laws in the Old Testament. Instead, we have been called to obey Christs law to love, which should guide our interactions with others as we strive to meet their needs.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

Jesus Explanation of a Neighbour Luke 10:29-36 Jesus discussion with the teacher of the law did not end with His command to do what he has confessed in verse 27, in order to inherit eternal life. Because he wanted to justify himself, he asked Jesus, Who is my neigbhour? Jesus made his question arguable when He told the story of the Good Samaritan to illustrate the true meaning of who a neighbour is. According to Jesus, a man was travelling from Jerusalem to Jericho when he was attacked by robbers who beat and left him half dead. Unfortunately, a priest and Levite both travelled the same route, yet failed to care for him, but when a Samaritan saw him, he had pity on him. He cared for him and took him to an inn. The next day, he paid two silver coins (equivalent to two days wages, Matthew 20:2) to his keepers with the promise to pay whatever else will be spent. Which of these three do you think was a neighbour to the man? Jesus asked. The man who had mercy on him, the man replied correctly. Jesus simply presented the Good Samaritan as a good neighbour because of his exemplary service to a stranger. It is worthy of note that the person Jesus commended among the three for doing good was from a hated nation (the Samaritans). The religious leaders (the priest and the Levite) paid no attention probably with the assumption that anyone who touches a human bone or a grave, will be unclean for seven days (Numbers 19:16). Well, it would have been better for a priest or Levite to be ceremonially unclean for seven days than to ignore the biblical principle of showing love to our neighbours who are in urgent need. These days, people are scared of showing hospitality to people. They deliberately ignore the command to meet the needs of their neighbours for fear of being robbed, attacked, wrongly accused, their indifferent attitude and some inconveniences involved. The story of the Good Samaritan is a reminder that it is obligatory for believers to ignore these excuses and always be ready to meet the needs of their neighbours because it is a key to inherit eternal life.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1. Why do people love titles and positions more than being true and faithful to Gods command to love their neighbours as themselves? 2.

Which one is more helpful: to perform religious duty or to meet an urgent need of someone?<\/p>\r\n","lesson3":"<p>C. The Command to Do Likewise Luke 10:37 The teacher of the laws response to Jesus question in verse 37 gives a better understanding of Jesus definition of who a neighbour is. The man said, The one who showed mercy to the stranger. In this way, Jesus removed limits to the definition of who a neighbour is to counter the Jews who regard only their fellow Jews as their neighbours. Jesus commanded the man saying, Go and do likewise. Ironically, most Jews held strong prejudice about the Samaritans but with the example of the Good Samaritan, Jesus challenged their narrow-mindedness with the law of love towards all, notwithstanding race or gender. It is surprising that where the priest and the Levite failed the test of showing love, a Samaritan did excellently well. He spent his time and money to ensure that the wounded man recovered quickly. He was a true keeper of the law of God. Even though it appears he does not know the law, his action reveals that the law had been written on his heart, unlike the priest and Levite who failed to help a neighbour who was in need. The implication of Jesus command to go and do likewise is applicable to all believers. We should not just read and talk about the law, we must be moved with the love of God to care for our neighbours. This suggests that we should remove all prejudices and segregation that sometimes hinder us from showing love, and __ care to others without any form of barrier they could be people who have been affected by natural disaster, diseases, bereavement, accident victims, abandoned children and other troubles.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1.

She was made the prayer coordinator during her final year in the university. She was able to coordinate the prayer meeting of the fellowship so much that more members became interested and attended regularly. Regular schedule was planned to enable members to lead each prayer session, as it was their structure. Everyone praised sister Grace for her creativity since she assumed office as the coordinator. However, she became arrogant because of her giftedness in speaking in __ tongues she felt that it is the most important of all spiritual gifts. She speaks in tongues at will sometimes to prove her spiritual maturity. Therefore, she sees herself as more spiritually mature than other members of the fellowship, despite the effort of the campus pastor to make her realise that all spiritual gifts have equal value except love that supersedes others, according to Paul. This attitude later resulted in division in the fellowship until God intervened and with humility, Sister Grace accepted her fault and asked for prayers from the members. The problem of Sister Grace is similar to that of the Christians in Corinth. Some of them claimed that the spiritual gift of speaking in tongues is more important than others. In his letter to them, Paul wrote to address the issue that all spiritual gifts have equal value except love, which is eternal but others are temporary. In other words, all other gifts will cease with time but the gift of love is endless. To him, the most important gifts are those that contribute to the good of all (1 Corinthians 12:7). Todays lesson is centred on the most excellent way to prove our love for God and our fellow brethren.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A.The Futility of Service without Love 1 Corinthians 13:1-3 In the previous chapter, Apostle Paul listed the various spiritual endowments, which the Holy Spirit gives to Gods people. The subject matter is so important that he repeated it in his letter to the church in Ephesus so that the body of Christ will be built up in the knowledge and development of the character of Christ (Ephesians 4:12). The issue of spiritual gifts was causing division in the Corinthian Church, with believers rating their gifts (speaking in tongues) as superior to the gifts of others. In order to correct the misconception, Paul wrote to them and explained the importance of all the gifts. According to verses 1 to 3, he exaggerated the futility of seeking virtue without love, which is supreme. He used some figurative symbols like resounding gong or clanging cymbals to represent the ineffectiveness of their spiritual gifts, if they do not have love. These musical instruments are known for reverberation whenever they are played. In essence, the manifestation of their socalled treasured gifts means nothing if it is not motivated by love. Thus he ended verses 2 and 3 with a phrase, I gain nothing. The Corinthian Church was greatly endowed with different spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues, prophecy, knowledge, faith, giving, etc. As important as these gifts are, Paul affirmed that their services or religion is meaningless, irrespective of their spiritual gifts, if they do not have love for one another, as God loves them. Like the case of Sister Grace, many Christians are zealous for the things of God, they speak in tongues, give, prophesy and manifest their spiritual gifts but they do not love. Such people do not have the fruit of the spirit or love for others because they do not know God. The author of 1 John said, everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God (1 John 4:7b). Some people unnecessarily place emphasis on other aspects of their spiritual gifts and undermine love, which is supreme. This attitude stands in contrast with the true meaning of love for God and humankind, which Paul emphasised in his letter. However, Paul did not play down the importance of the other gifts; after all, he himself excels in speaking in tongues but it does not top the list on his scale of values.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1. Discuss the reason most people celebrate the gifts of the Spirit more than the fruit of the Spirit. 2. If you are given the opportunity to make a choice of the gifts you desire most, which one will you choose and why? 3. Why is love considered as the most important attribute in Christian service?<\/p>\r\n","lesson2":"<p>B. The Characteristics of True Love 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 In continuation on the discussion of the importance of love as the most valuable attribute, Apostle Paul enumerated the features of love for the sake of emphasis. From verse 4, he described them both positively and negatively. He said love is: \u00b7 Patient and kind. It does not envy, boast, neither is it proud. This means anyone who loves is good-natured, gentle, tender, and such does not have the desire to revenge because of the enduring nature of love. \u00b7 Not rude, self-seeking, not easily angered or keeps record of wrongdoing. On the contrary, those who have love are polite and do not delight in keeping record of wrongdoings. It does not delight in evil but rejoices when the truth prevails. \u00b7 It possesses the ability to protect, always trusts, hopes and perseveres, no matter the provocation. \u00b7 It does not fail because it is not partial in nature like the gifts of prophecy, speaking in tongues and knowledge that are temporal in nature. By implication, love will continue to be in existence till eternity <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The importance of love in the life of a Christian cannot be over-emphasised, especially when we consider the features as discussed above. More importantly, one of the benefits of love when it is manifested is that it shows itself in the way mature Christians deal with disagreements and disunity in the church, especially the fact that the person concerned is not easily provoked or self-seeking.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1. Discuss the effects of the manifestation of true love in your church and how to sustain it.<\/p>\r\n","lesson3":"<p>C. The Greatness of Love 1 Corinthians 13:9-13 Apostle Paul concluded his letter with an admonition to the Corinthians to maintain the most excellent way. He gave an illustration of this in verse 9 that our gifts of knowledge and inspired messages are only partial and they will disappear when the perfect comes. He means that when Christ returns and Gods saving work is finished (Philippians 1:6), there will no longer be need for the use of spiritual gifts to build up the church. According to verse 11, he gave another beautiful picture of his spiritual maturity. He said, When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.He likens what we see presently with an image in a mirror but with a promise to see face to face probably at the judgment day when Christ shall return. However, three things will remain: faith, hope and love and the greatest of them is love because it will endure till eternity and thus it is the most excellent way. Pauls conclusion about love as the greatest of the three spiritual gifts is worth mentioning. It is the most important virtue that exerts a wider influence and its ability to overcome evil, protect and endure. Faith and hope rather pertain to individuals but love helps us to relate with God and humankind in the larger society. Love is, therefore, more important than all other graces and endowments like the gifts of prophecy and miracles, speaking in tongues and knowledge. It will outlive all the other gifts, even though they temporarily co-exist. For these reasons, the gift of love is more preferable to Paul than all other gifts, which almost caused disunity in the church before his letter.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1.

It happened when the Womens Missionary Society (WMS) of the church could no longer afford to pay someone to clean the toilets due to financial constraints. For a long time, the toilets and urinals became dirty, having offensive and uninviting odour so much that it caused embarrassment to the church. In his attempt to encourage the people on the need to demonstrate love through service, the Pastor gave examples of how members of some Pentecostal churches, who are highly placed in the society, offer to clean their church toilets with joy and passion. The following Sunday, the pastor and his wife woke up very early in the morning and cleaned the toilets with all sense of humility. When the deacons heard about it, they were troubled. However, when they contacted the pastor, he simply said, I am a servant, go and do likewise. Of course, they were challenged and resolved to have a roster for the cleaning of the toilets, starting with their chairman. Eventually, the Women Missionary Society agreed to bear the financial responsibility of cleaning the toilets again. The word Service originated from a Latin word Servitium meaning to be a servant. Jesus love for His disciples is evidenced in His selfless act of washing their feet, when actually it was the responsibility of the servants to wash the feet of their Master. Todays lesson is a practical demonstration of humility, love and service to others as shown by Jesus to His disciples. Indeed, this act is contrary to the understanding of the world about humility and service.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Jesus Demonstrates True Greatness John 13:1-9 Jesus spent the last few hours before the end of His public ministry with His disciples adequately preparing them for the continuation of the ministry. However, He knew the hour for Him to leave this world and go to His Father had come. Already, the Devil had put the thought of betraying Him in the heart of Judas Iscariot, son of Simon while the evening meal was being served. Interestingly, Jesus had a foreknowledge of three important things about the situation: That the Father has given Him complete power; the fact that He came from God and was going back to Him (v. 3). Therefore, He arose from the table, took off His garment and wrapped a towel around His waist. He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and dry them with the towel. The experience was strange to Simon Peter thus he objected and did not want Jesus to perform this lowly service majorly performed by servants. He said to Jesus, Lord, are you going to wash my feet? (v. 6) Even though they did not understand the implication of the exercise but Jesus response in verses 7 and 8b explained the importance. Thus Peter replied in verse 9 saying, ...not just my feet but my hands and my head as well. Jesus act is a replica of John the Baptists initial reaction to Jesus baptism (Matthew 3:14). According to the Jewish culture, it was usually the duty of the host to provide water for his guest to wash his feet (Genesis 18:4; 19:2). In this case, Jesus voluntarily offered to wash the feet of His disciples to show them humility and true greatness. This happened before the Feast of the Passover when He was preparing for His departure to meet with His Father in heaven. Jesus washing of the disciples feet is symbolic. As the host in His Fathers house, He demonstrated hospitality to His guests, the disciples. It is a lesson that whosoever wants to be great in life must be ready to love and serve others in humility. However, the reverse is the case with many leaders today. Rather than showing hospitality, humility and serving others in love, they enjoy being served and respected. They claim superiority over their followers and demand for their recognition, respect and service. This is quite the opposite of the life of Jesus who demonstrated true greatness by washing the feet of His disciples, even though He is God.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1. What is your view about some churches that still practise Feet Washing? 2. Mention instances where leaders in your church have demonstrated service to others in humility and how it has affected their understanding of service to others.<\/p>\r\n","lesson2":"<p>B. The Command to Serve One Another John 13:10-15 Jesus response to Simon Peters request to have his hands and head washed is remarkable. It explains the spiritual purity a person needs in order to have a saving relationship with God and live a fruitful life. Jesus said, A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.(v. 10) Of course, Jesus knew who was going to betray Him because He knows all humans and as such, He does not need the testimony of humankind (John 2:24-25); hence He said not everyone is clean. When He had finished washing their feet, He put on His garment and went back to the table. Do you understand what I have just done to you? He asked them. Jesus declared the reason for washing their feet. As the Lord and Teacher had washed their feet, the disciples also ought to wash one anothers feet through love and service offered in humility. He concluded in verse 15 with the command, I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. Jesus exemplary lifestyle and the instruction to imitate Him in serving one another in our text have set the standard for servant leadership. It is no gainsay that these teachings are contrary to the belief of the world, but Jesus had made it clear that His followers should emulate Him as they serve one another in love and humility. It is not uncommon today to see some leaders instead of humbly serving the people in accordance to Jesus command, they prefer to be served and respected. This is contrary to Jesus teaching about servant leadership.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

The Call to Show Love through Service John 13:34-35 Jesus knew that His time on earth will soon end. After Judas left Him, He explained the revelation of His glory and that of His Father, which shall be revealed through Him. Specifically, He stated in verse 33 that He would only be with them for a while but the disciples cannot go to the place He is going (vv. 31-33). Based on the information of His physical absence, He gave a new command to them to love one another (v. 34a). He charged them to practically demonstrate genuine love toward one another just as He had done to them. The admonition to love one another became necessary because it is the only proof that they are His disciples. The commandment to love one another is repeatedly stressed in the Scriptures, both in the Old and New Testaments. In actual fact, Jesus new commandment to His disciples to love one another sums up the Christian way of life. It will be a mark of their brotherhood, created by Christs great love for them (Mark 12:30-31; Luke10:27), particularly when He will no longer be with them physically. Although it is sometimes difficult and seems impossible to show genuine love to others in this wicked generation; however, Christians should remember that it is Jesus command, and one of the ways to prove to the world that we are His followers. When we love one another, we are able to serve God and humankind without reservation.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1. Some people are tagged unlovable in our society.

Out of excitement, the boy plugged the toy without switching on the socket for proper connection and flow of current. Immediately, he screamed, Daddy, the car is not moving After a careful examination, his father discovered that it was not properly connected so as to receive free flow of electricity. It is generally believed that nothing happens on its own or by chance. There must be something responsible for it. This is what the scientists and philosophers call the Universal Law of Cause and Effect. Many scholars agree that for every effect, there is a definite cause; likewise, for every cause, there is an effect. Supposedly, there are consequences for every action we undertake in life and the law cuts across every human sector, Christians inclusive. Todays lesson can be likened to the story above about a young boy who expected his toy car to work without proper connection to electricity source. Having promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His disciples (John 14:26), Jesus emphasised the importance of their relationship and dependence on Him. He said only if they remain united with Him will they bear fruit because without Him, no one can do anything.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A.The Condition for Fruitfulness John 15:4-8 The discourse of The Vine and the Branches took place between the time Jesus and His disciples left the upper room (John 14:31) and their arrival at Gethsemane (John 18:1). To his credit, the account is only recorded by John, the beloved. It is probable that Jesus and His disciples were passing through a vineyard and decided to use the illustration of the vineyard to pass His message. He started the discussion by introducing Himself as the True Vine while God, His Father, is the Gardener (15:1). This is followed by an instruction in verse 4 to remain in Him and He will remain in them. The command is repeated in verse 5, for the sake of emphasis because abiding in Christ is necessary for fruitfulness. On the contrary, anyone who fails to remain in Christ is likened to a withered branch of a tree thrown into the fire and burned. It is obvious that fruit-bearing is dependent on abiding in Christ, otherwise one will remain spiritually barren. In other words, one must be in a relationship with Jesus like a toy car that is properly connected to power source in order to move. Besides, there is certainty of receiving answers to ones request when we remain in Him and His words remain in us. Such fruitfulness brings glory to the Father and shows that we are His disciples (v. 8). After all, no branch bears fruit on its own. It must remain on the vine for nourishment, growth and fruitfulness. These commands became necessary for Jesus disciples so that they will be able to stand firm, even in the face of persecution. It is sad that today, many Christians find it difficult to abide in Jesus and His Word. While some see God as too slow, others believe in their efforts, earthly wisdom, talents and even their family name to become successful. They often forget that these are ephemeral things that cannot be compared with abiding in Christ in order to bear fruit that glorify God.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

The Command to Love One another John 15:9-13 The fact has been established that if only the disciples will abide in Jesus they would be able to bear fruits (vv. 4-6). Again, Jesus stressed the importance of obedience to His command and the loving relationship between Him and His Father. Based on that, He said in verse 10, If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Fathers commands and remain in his love. The command to love one another became necessary so that they may remain in His love too so that their joy might be complete. The same admonition was echoed by Apostle Paul in his letter to the brethren in Philippi. He admonished them to make his joy complete by having the same mind, love, purpose and oneness in spirit (Philippians 2:1-4). The command to love one another as He has loved them is repeated in verse 12. After all, the greatest love a person can have for his friends is to give his life for them. Jesus demonstrated this great love through His death on the cross, not just for His disciples but for the whole world (John 3:16). Therefore, we can say that the love Christ has shown us is not only in words but also in action through His sacrificial death. Therefore, one of the conditions to abide in Jesus is to love Him and obey His commands. Some other ways Christians can prove that they love Jesus is by giving themselves to His service, knowing His Word and communicating with Him daily. It can also be by reaching the unsaved with the message of the Gospel and giving sacrificially to His work. It is important to stress the fact that believers cannot faithfully obey Jesus commands and others if they do not know His Word because His Word is His command that propels us to love Him and other people.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

Conditions for Becoming Jesus Friend John 15:14-17 The fact that Jesus is a friend of all cannot be overemphasised but we should be mindful of the conditions that authenticate such friendship. He said in verse 14, You are my friends if you do what I command. Thereafter, He affirmed that He would no longer call those who obey His command servants because servants do not know what their master is doing. Instead, He promised to call them friends because He has told them everything He had learned from His Father (v. 15). Usually, disciples have the choice of a rabbi to whom they want to be attached but the reverse was the case with Jesus. The disciples did not choose Him; rather, He appointed them for the purpose of bearing fruit that will endure. Upon fulfilling this mandate, the Father will hear and grant their request made in His Name. Again, He commanded them to love one another like He earlier told them in verse 12. There is no doubt that total obedience is one of the conditions of becoming a friend of Jesus as it is stated in verse 14. Interestingly, He made a distinction between a servant and a friend as well as the level of their closeness to their master. According to Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary, a friend is a person who has the same interests and opinions as oneself. Even today, the condition of becoming Jesus friend remains relevant to all Christians. Those who will obey and love Him passionately will certainly bear fruit that endure. Although many claim to be Jesus friend, yet they do not show sincere love, obey His commands or spend quality time with Him. Friendship demands spending quality time together in order to understand one another better <\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1.

We often forget Gods repeated command to believers to love one another as He had loved us. A story was told of a cripple who usually sits by the roadside to beg for alms. Having observed this man for some time, Mr Samuel Okomu decided to show him love in words and deeds. Each time he passed by, he would greet, embrace the cripple, give him a peck and sometimes food \/money and other things. One day, the man said to Mr Samuel, Are you God? I know it is only God that loves all kinds of people without discrimination. Mr Samuel remembered his pastors words that The only way believers can measure the reality of their love for God is when we love our fellow humankind, notwithstanding their circumstances, gender or tribe. The book of First John was purposely written to expose the works of false teachers who taught that the human Jesus was not the same as the Divine Christ (1 John 2:22; 4:1-3). The book also emphasises sincere love among brethren as a standard for every Christian in their relationship with one another. Todays lesson focuses on loving one another as Christ has commanded and the willingness to give ones life for others, as Christ did (John 3:16).<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Genuine Love Explained 1 John 3:11-15 One of the virtues in the Christian community is genuine love (Jesus type) that believers have for one another. According to John, in verse 11, the command to love one another has been from the beginning (1 John 2:7; Leviticus 19:18). John made reference to Cain, who killed his brother Abel. Thus, he reveals why Christians are hated and killed because of their righteousness, just as Cain did to his brother Abel. The consciousness of passing from life unto death is stressed in verse 14 because we love our fellow brothers. However, John further emphasised that anyone who hates his brother is a murderer and such a person does not have eternal life with Him. Of course, it is a reminder that every believer must come to this reality that he \/she has passed from death unto life; therefore, he \/she no longer abides in death but is alive in Christ. The reality is evident in loving other brethren. Thus anyone who does not love remains in death. In fact, such a person is a murderer, who will never reign with God eternally. Love is a strong feeling of deep affection that a person has towards another person or a thing. It also means to be devoted to something. Everybody enjoys being loved but not everybody is ready to pay the price of loving others according to Jesus repeated command. However, Jesus wants believers to go extra mile in demonstrating genuine love to all, irrespective of age, status, religion, ethnicity and background. Loving one another is so important that Apostle Paul admonished the brethren in Rome saying, Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law. (Romans 13:8) When believers exhibit genuine love, we will be able to overcome hatred and by so doing, our community will be affected and those who hate us will come to the saving knowledge of Christ.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1. What does it mean to pass from death unto life according to verse 14? 2. Discuss some common things that make people of the world hate Christians? 3. Is there hatred amongst Christians? Why?<\/p>\r\n","lesson2":"<p>B.Genuine Love Demonstrated 1 John 3:16-20 John was able to balance His teaching, which centred on loving one another. The fact that believers have been shown love through the sacrificial death of Jesus makes it mandatory for us to lay down our lives for our brethren as we demonstrate genuine love to them. He explains in verse 17 that rich people who see their brother or sister in need, yet close their hearts against them cannot claim to love God. After all, one of the ways to prove our love for one another is when we share our material possessions with our fellow brethren, as the early church did (Acts 4:32-35). The claim is similar to James illustration of the emptiness of words and speech with actions (James 2:15-17). However, he carefully highlighted three steps of demonstrating genuine love in the same verse. They include: \u00b7 Observation: The needy should be identified, especially by the rich who should find ways of meeting such needs. \u00b7 Sympathy and Empathy: Love for our fellow brothers should motivate us to show pity and to understand what they are going through. \u00b7 Sharing: The first two steps should propel us to share our material possessions with others. When this is done, then we can claim to have the love of God according to John who said, Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth. This then is how we know that we belong to the truth, and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence. (1 John 3:18-19). He added that doing these will give our hearts rest in His presence. One of the things that characterised the early church was her demonstration of genuine love towards one another. It was not just love in words or feelings but in practical terms to the extent that the difference between the rich and poor was not noticed. Similarly, Gods love toward humanity was demonstrated when He sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ to die for the sins of humankind. In like manner, Christians have been called to love one another with the love of Christ. It can be shown through the giving of materials things, time, godly advice and other possible ways. If Jesus Christ could shed His blood for the remission of the sins of humankind, believers should be willing to give sacrificially to the needy. After all, one of the ways genuine love can be measured is through giving.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1. What are the benefits of demonstrating love? 2. How can a believer lay down his life for his brother(s)? 3. How do Christians love with words or tongue?<\/p>\r\n","lesson3":"<p>C. The Command to Believe and Love 1 John 3:21-24 The latter part of the passage discloses the gains of not being condemned by our hearts (i.e. conscience). He said, Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God and receive from him anything we ask, because we obey his commands and do what pleases him. (vv. 21-22). Again, John echoes the command to Christians to believe in the name of the Son, Jesus Christ (John 6:29) and to love one another (John 13:34-35), in accordance with Jesus command. He affirmed that those who obey Gods command will live in union with God and He will live in them. This is made possible because of the spirit God has given to believers. Basically, the two commandments of the Christian community are: to believe in the Son of God, Jesus Christ and to love one another. Obviously, when these virtues are in the life of a believer, such a person is a child of God because of the work of Christ (v. 21). It also results to answered prayer (v. 22). As seen in verse 24, obedience to Gods command is crucial to receiving Gods blessings because it strengthens ones relationship with God. The confirmation that He lives in the believer is the Spirit of God who dwells in us because the Holy Spirit is the seal of the believer and it bears witness that we are no longer condemned.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1.

The fellowship centres was rotated from house to house because all the churches in the community had been burnt down without immediate hope to rebuild. Those whose houses were burnt were graciously accommodated, fed, and clothed by other brethren as well as those who lost other valuable items. Particularly, one of the members voluntarily terminated his five hundred thousand naira fixed deposit and shared the money among some of them so as to enable them start their businesses again. Farmers among them regularly supplied foodstuff, traders whose wares were not destroyed supplied good clothes and other things. The teachers and doctors willingly played their roles without collecting money for their services. Indeed, it was a beautiful scenario that can best be described as Sharing love in truth because no one lacked anything. This was the testimony of Pastor Wadama Sule from one of the Northern Conferences after the attack of Boko Haram, some years ago. The climax of the testimony was that many people identified with the church because of the unity displayed by the brethren. The story above can be likened to the experience of the early church. Shortly after Jesus resurrection, the early disciples enjoyed the benefits of sharing love in truth. In the true spirit of fellowship, they voluntarily shared what they had together. Some even sold their lands and gave the money to the apostles, who in turn distributed it to those who had needs. Unlike the early church, it seems contemporary believers do not have the same mindset as many live in affluence while others experience lack and suffer in silence. Thus todays lesson focuses on the need to care for fellow Christians by sharing what they have in truth and not in deceit or show-off.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. The Believers Shared their Possessions Acts 4:32-37 After the Pentecost experience, the apostles were filled with the Holy Spirit and were able to speak the Word of God boldly (Acts 4:31). The aftermath of the event brought increase to the church, even though more needs arose. However, all the believers were so united in heart and mind that no one claimed that any of his possessions was his but they shared everything in common (v. 32). In other words, there were no needy persons among them. From time to time, land and house owners sold them and brought the money to the apostles who further distributed it according to the needs of the people. Notable among them was Joseph, from Cyprus, whom the apostles named Barnabas (meaning Son of Encouragement). He willingly sold a piece of land and handed over the money to the apostles for onward distribution (v. 37). From the passage, it is apparent that the brethren: \u00b7 Were all united (v. 32b). \u00b7 They were not selfish (v. 35). \u00b7 They truly shared love in truth. \u00b7 The gap between the poor and rich was bridged. \u00b7 There were no needy persons among them (4:34). Truly, these indications are some benefits of communal living in any Christian community. The early church understood the concept of sharing love in truth and communal living and they practised it to the letter. Communal living is the idea of people living together, sharing possessions and responsibilities as a big family. It gives everybody a sense of belonging without discrimination. Besides, it enhances unity, a good way of presenting the gospel message to the unsaved and a means of fulfilling the kingdom mandate of caring for one another. By implication, it is the secret to kingdom expansion as seen in the early church. Undoubtedly, it is a sign of a healthy church. This implies that God is not happy when any member of His household is suffering while he \/she can be helped by those who are rich around them.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

Ananias and Sapphira Conspired to Lie Acts 5:1-4 Barnabas set an example of generous giving by bringing the money he sold from a piece of land to the apostles to distribute to the needy among them. Probably, Ananias and Sapphira were motivated to do likewise but not with love, truth and sincerity of heart. Having sold the land, the couple conspired and kept back part of the money probably for themselves before Ananias handed over the balance to the apostles. By the help of the Holy Spirit and through the gift of discernment, Peter knew that Ananias was not truthful. He said to him, Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land?(v. 3) Of course, they had the right to keep a part of the money for their up-keep because the land belongs to him before it was sold. Peter publicly made it known that what he (Ananias) had done was satanic; he lied against the Holy Spirit and not against men. Although Ananias was the one who sold the land, yet Sapphira obviously participated in the deceitful act because she consented to her husbands plan to keep part of the money and lie to Peter. Actually, their sin was not the amount Ananias brought to Peter but that they lied that that was the exact amount they sold the land. After all, the contributions and sharing among the brethren was not mandatory but spontaneous and voluntary (v. 4). Another example is the case of Achan who violated the command not to take anything from Jericho. Eventually, Achan and his entire family members were stoned to death (Joshua 7:1-25). In the same manner, some Christians lie about their resources and giving with the assumption that God understands. Christians should be reminded that our gifts to God must be with truthfulness of the heart instead of lying and pretense, because of the punishment it attracts. We should remember that nothing is hidden from God; He knows and sees every plot against Him, even in our inner room or thought.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

The people who heard about the incident were greatly frightened. Probably because of the Jewish custom that calls for a quick burial of the dead, if possible before the day is over, Ananias corpse was wrapped and carried by some young men for burial. His wife, Sapphira came about three hours later without knowing that her husband was dead. Peter said, Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the land? Unfortunately, she failed Peters test. Sapphira replied, that is the price. (v. 8) Nevertheless, Peter regarded her response as a test of the Holy Spirit and said to her, Look! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also.On hearing this, she fell down and died and was buried beside her husband, by the same men. The penalty of conspiring against the Holy Spirit is severe as it is seen in the life of Ananias and Sapphira. They died the same day because they chose to conspire against God and the Holy Spirit. The incident brought great fear to the Christian community in Jerusalem and all who heard about it. Like the case of Ananias and his wife Sapphira, God does not tolerate hypocrisy and deceit, no matter who is involved. The Scripture makes it clear that death is the wages of sin (Romans 6:23; James 1:15). Two things would have been needful: one of the couple would have revolted against the plan to lie and disclose the real amount the land was sold to Peter and how they have kept a part for their family upkeep. Sadly, they both connived and lied against the Holy Spirit probably with the assumption that their dishonesty will not be known. They died as a result of their deceit, which suggests that every sin goes with its punishment and it can be in any form. The summary of this lesson is that God still punishes every act of dishonesty and conspiracy. Therefore, people should not conspire to sin, especially when one brings ungodly suggestions. This calls for sensitivity to the Holy Spirit and humility of heart to always yield to corrections whenever the need arises.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1.

The newly constructed worship auditorium was to be dedicated and so, many dignitaries from all walks of life were invited to the occasion. As the invited guests began to arrive, they were ushered by some beautifully dressed young ladies to their various designated seats. Unfortunately, all the guests were not accorded the same respect by the ushers. Mrs Ugo Harrison was one of the invited guests and because she was early to church, she took her seat at her choice place. She observed with keen interest that while the rich were treated with dignity and courtesy the so-called poor were ordered to take their seats at the back or to find a place under the canopy outside the auditorium. According to Mrs Ugo, the fact that all the guests were treated differently made her ruminate on the attitude displayed by the ushers and what would have influenced their biased action. Does the picture look like what happens in your church? Nevertheless, at the close of service, Mrs Ugo called the attention of one of the ushers to the book of James that warns against partiality (favouritism) in the church. The young lady simply said, Well, we only acted on instructions from the committee. However, I am sorry if I have offended you in anyway. The story above is a common practice in some churches today. Some churches have metamorphosed into social circles where the poor are treated and made to understand they are not wanted. They are usually treated with disrespect and dishonour while the rich are accorded undue respect. The Bible repeatedly teaches that believers should love one another, notwithstanding the differences in our social and financial status, tribe, educational attainment and so on. It is, therefore, wrong for anyone to dishonour the poor by treating them as if they are less than the rich.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Warning against Prejudice James 2:1-4 The author of the book of James used many figures of speech to present instructions regarding practical wisdom and guidance for Christian attitudes and conduct. In chapter 2 precisely, he warned against the show of prejudice among Christians. He said in verse 1, My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, dont show favouritism. It means they should not treat people differently based on their outward appearance. The warning is followed by a scenario of a well-adorned rich man and a poor man in rags who came to a meeting. According to verse 3, they will be guilty of creating distinctions among themselves if more attention is given to the rich man by providing a special seat for him while the poor man is ignored or given less courtesy. In that case, they would have based their judgment on evil motives, which contradicts Gods standard of loving our neighbour as ourselves and doing the right thing. To show partiality is the same as to make judgments or distinctions based on peoples external appearance, especially by what they wear. However, the command to treat the poor and foreigners with fairness and justice is from the Old Testament. The law of God prohibits discrimination against the poor and foreigners and giving special attention to the rich. Rather, Christians are encouraged to love God wholly and to love our neighbours as ourselves. Throughout the earthly ministry of Jesus, He did not show partiality. He related well with the poor, sinners, the sick and isolated. If Jesus did not discriminate in relating with people, Christians should, therefore, not show favouritism among themselves. Of course, the reason is that it causes division in the church, it gives honour to those who not deserve it and it is incompatible with faith in Jesus Christ and the royal law. Everyone who has put their faith in Christ Jesus is required to treat others fairly, irrespective of status, sex or race, thereby imitating Jesus Christ.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>\u00b7 Differentiate the state of showing partiality and respect to others. \u00b7 What are the results of showing prejudice in the church of God? \u00b7 How can equality be promoted in the church?<\/p>\r\n","lesson2":"<p>B. Choosing the Poor for a Purpose James 2:5-7 In continuation, the author of James revealed Gods purpose of choosing the poor. He said, Listen, my dear brothers: Has God not chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him? (v. 5) Supposedly, God has selected those who are poor in material possessions to be rich in faith so that they will possess the kingdom which He had promised to give to those who love Him. Jesus alluded to this fact when He said to His disciples, Happy are you poor; the kingdom of God is yours! (Luke 6:20). Unfortunately, the poor are often dishonoured and looked down upon, yet the rich who enjoy undue respect are those who exploit, oppress and drag Gods people to court. Such rich people speak evil of the name of Jesus Christ. It is apparent from the passage that partiality among Christians gives honour to those who do not deserve it. The rich are the oppressors of the poor and some of them blaspheme against God without fear. They exploit the poor in the society. They influence courts decisions in their own favour with their ill-gotten wealth, thereby making the poor poorer, yet when they come to the church, they are celebrated without any knowledge of their sources of wealth. Christians should be reminded that it is wrong for anyone to dishonour the poor by treating them as if they are less important than those who are rich in material possessions. According to the author of the book of James, such people do not deserve honour but the faithful brethren should be given fair treatment and recognition to the glory of God.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

He made it clear in verse 8 that if the kingdom law of loving ones neighbour as oneself is sustained according to the Scriptures, the right things would have been done. On the contrary, if people are treated based on their outward appearance, we will be regarded as sinners and law-breakers. Therefore, anyone who breaks any of the commandments will be guilty of breaking them all. After all, the same law that is against the sin of adultery is also against the sin of murder. Automatically, one becomes a law-breaker if he \/she commits any sins. In verse 12, the author admonished the people to speak and act as people who will be judged by the law that gives freedom. The encouragement is based on the fact that on the day of judgment, God will not show mercy to those who have not been merciful (Matthew 5:7), because mercy triumphs over judgment. The importance of obeying the law wholly cannot be over-emphasised. It is one of the ways of showing impartial love to others, which the author of the book of James encouraged his readers to demonstrate. Christians have been called to obey the laws of God exclusively, otherwise our obedience will not be complete and we will be guilty of breaking the law of the kingdom (v. 9). We should be ready to follow Gods standard of the royal law of loving our neighbours as much as we love ourselves. In fact, Jesus teachings prioritised the love of our neighbour as central to the law. <\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1. What are the laws of the kingdom as the author puts it in verse 8a? 2.

They have been baptised into the membership of the church, yet they lack the understanding of the superiority of Jesus. In comparison with the Old Testament revelation that was fragmented, Jesus Christ is the final and complete revelation of God, according to the author of Hebrews. He is superior to the angels, Moses and Joshua through whom God spoke to His people in the past. But in this new age, God has chosen to speak to us through His Son (Jesus Christ) with whom He created the universe. The author further describes Jesus as the reflection of the brightness of Gods glory, the image of His own being who possesses the power to sustain the universe. In the Jewish culture, the firstborn son had the honour and privilege that were recognised and valued. Therefore, Jesus Christ, the firstborn and only Son of God is far greater, more excellent and superior to all the angels and creation. The gospel according to Matthew introduces His genealogy through Abraham and David (Matthew 1:1-16). He proclaimed Jesus as the Messiah, who has been promised from the line of David. Therefore, Jesus is Gods fulfilment whose reign as the King and the Messiah will never end. Todays lesson focuses on the greatness of Gods Son, Jesus and His genealogy, who though being fully God came in human flesh through the Abrahamic and Davidic line to fulfil the Scriptures. Therefore, we (believers) have been called to share in His heritage as Gods sons and daughters by virtue of our faith in Jesus Christ.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Jesus, As Gods Inheritance Hebrews 1:1-5 From time immemorial, God always communicate His mind and purpose to humankind through various means, not necessarily through the prophets as mentioned in the passage. Specifically in time past, the word of God came to our fathers through prophets, judges, priests and kings in various ways and by His sovereign power and authority, He spoke the world into existence (Genesis 1ff). Nevertheless, Gods method of speaking His mind and will, under the New Testament dispensation, is through Jesus Christ, the revelation of God but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe (v. 2). Therefore, Jesus is Gods inheritance, the reflection of His glory and His exact image. After purging us of our sins, He sat at the right hand of God; the place of honour (v. 3). In verse 4, the author affirmed that Jesus Christ is greater than the angels as the name He has inherited is superior to theirs. Verse 5 outlines ways Jesus is superior to the angels: \u00b7 He is the only Son of God and has inherited a more excellent name than the angels. After all, no angel or believer has ever been addressed as the Son of God. The title exclusively belongs to Jesus and it signifies His Deity. \u00b7 There has never been a Father-Son relationship between God and the angels. But when God was about to send His Firstborn into the world He said, Let all Gods angels worship him. (v. 6) \u00b7 Jesus is the only reflection of Gods glory and the exact image of God (Colossians 1:15, 19). \u00b7 He is the ultimate revelation of God to humankind who was both active in creation and not the angels (John 1:1-3). \u00b7 He is seated at Gods right hand (v. 4). This refers to a position of authority that makes Him better than all others, and is continuous (Hebrews 5:10a). It exceeds that of the prophets, priests or angels. \u00b7 Jesus has the power to pass unto His followers (believers) this inheritance, which is rooted and founded in Him However, the fact remains that Jesus is superior to angels because they worship and serve Him and not vice versa. He is a greater messenger than the angels and prophets because though the prophets revealed the mind of God, they themselves did not have the nature of God neither were they ever active in the salvation of humanity. As the Heir of all things, He sustains all things by His divine power. He is the Mediator and through His death and resurrection, He completed the redemptive work as the Saviour of the world. Therefore, He has passed an eternal inheritance to those called to follow Him (Hebrews 9:15). The only way we can respond to Him as the inheritance of God is to worship, serve and obey Him in all things.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

Jesus Genealogy Explained Matthew 1:1- 6 The issue of knowing and identifying with ones descendants is very important in the history of humanity. The coming of Jesus Christ into the world had been anticipated from the beginning. In the early days of human history, God had chosen the family of Abraham through whose descendants He would bless the whole human race (Genesis 12:3), and later through the family of David. Verse 2 of the passage attests to the fact that Abraham is the origin of the genealogy of Jesus. He was the father of Isaac, the father of Jacob, the father of Judah and his brothers. The list of Jesus ancestors continues until verse 5 where Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, and Obed the father of Jesse, whose mother was Ruth were all identified as part of Jesus descendants. Although it is not stated in the passage but it is most likely that the essence of the comprehensive nature of the genealogy is designed to show that Jesus is the Messiah, the Jewish King through whom Gods divine purpose for humanity would be accomplished (Matthew 1:21). It is also to prove that Jesus was both the Son of Abraham, the father of the Jewish nation through whom the world was to be blessed (v. 2; Genesis 12:2). He is also the son of David, the father of the Jewish kingdom and this gives Him kingship rights. However, there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to Jechoniah; and another fourteen from Jechoniah to Jesus (v. 17). A careful study of the genealogy of Jesus will help us to understand Gods plan of salvation to imperfect humans. It will also remind us of the importance of knowing our family history and connection as well as remind us of our inheritance and calling as Gods children. It is sad to note that many people are not aware of their heritage neither do they know their family history. From this passage, Christian parents should endeavour to make their children know their ancestral history as much as they know and possibly connect with one another as part of Gods family. If possible, such history can be documented for posterity so that our children will grow, read and know their family tree.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

Jesus Rich Heritage Matthew 1:16-17 Jesus had a rich heritage as it is stated from verse 1 to 17 of the passage. Altogether, there were fourteen generations from the time of Abraham to the time of David, fourteen from David to the period of their exile in Babylon and another fourteen generations from the time of the exile to the birth of Jesus Christ. The biblical account of Jesus birth is explained in verse 18. His birth confirms the fulfilment of Gods promise through Prophet Isaiah (Isaiah 7:10-16). His mother, Mary was already engaged to Joseph, but before they came together as husband and wife, Mary was found to be with a child through the Holy Spirit (v. 18). In other words, the child which Mary conceived was only made possible by the power of the Holy Spirit because there was no sexual relationship between Joseph and Mary before then. According to the Jewish culture, an engagement stage of a marriage relationship was legally binding, and could only be broken by a formal act of divorce (Luke 1:27). Jesus, with His rich heritage, gave all humans the opportunity to become members of the kingdom and, therefore, partakers of the Abrahamic and Davidic covenants (Ephesians 2:11-14). The implication is that believers also have rich heritage through their salvation relationship with Jesus (John 1:12).<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time3":"<p>1.

As Christians, we should be joyful because of the coming of the Saviour to save humankind. God works in ways that no one can easily understand. At the fullness of time, He decided to carry out His redemptive plan, using Mary as an instrument for the fulfilment of the Old Testament prophecy about the coming Messiah. Mary was a virgin who lived in Nazareth, a town in Galilee. She was already betrothed to Joseph, a descendant of David, but were not yet living together as a couple. However, because she was favoured by God, she was found to be pregnant through the power of the Holy Spirit. According to Gods plan for her, she had a divine assignment to fulfil and she accepted it without hesitation. She displayed a high level of submissiveness and faith under such humanly difficult circumstances and experienced Gods faithfulness. Indeed, the birth of Jesus can be described as Called before Birth because of the circumstances that surrounded the event. Before He was born, He had been called to be the Saviour and Messiah of the world, according to the Old Testament prophesies. Todays lesson centres on the call of Jesus before He was born. We shall also discuss Josephs confusion when he found out that Mary was with child when actually they had not copulated as husband and wife. Being a righteous man, Joseph demonstrated obedience. He took Mary as his wife but they had no union until Mary gave birth to a Child through whom the whole world has been saved and the Child was named Jesus, as the angel had instructed.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. The Angelic Visit Matthew 1:18-21 In Hebrew custom, marriages were arranged by parents and contracts negotiated on behalf of their children. This was the stage Joseph and Mary were in their relationship when she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. Joseph knew he was not responsible for the pregnancy since they had not been living together. Therefore, Marys integrity and life were at stake. In verse 19, Joseph decided to divorce her quietly without exposing her to public shame and disgrace. This shows that Joseph was really a righteous man, as described in the passage. Meanwhile as Joseph was contemplating, an angel appeared to him in his dream with a vivid explanation of the source and purpose of the Son conceived by Mary. He said to him, Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.(vv. 20-21) Marys sudden pregnancy was shocking to Joseph because His love and trust for Mary was betrayed and his uprightness and stance for justice was on the line. God understood Josephs struggle with the sudden news of Marys pregnancy and the implications; therefore, He sent an angel to calm his fears, and prevent him from acting contrary to Gods will. Having explained the source of Marys pregnancy, he was instructed to take Mary home as his wife. God will always reveal the reason for His actions. The name of Marys Son was to be Jesus, which when interpreted in Hebrew is Yehoshua (Joshua), meaning Yahweh saves. The name was given because of the function He would perform (v. 21), the reason He was called before He was born (Luke 4:18-21). God will not leave any of His children in perpetual confusion and despair. He is always seeking for ways to calm our fears and worries, like the case of Joseph. It is, therefore, important for Christians to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit when we are confused and listen to the voice of God through the Holy Spirit for direction.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

The Obedient Joseph Matthew 1:22-26 The Scripture is full of Gods divine plan for humanity, which are unfolded from time to time; even in the life of Jesus, the Saviour of the world. The angels message of the news of the birth of Jesus was a fulfilment of what the Lord had said through the prophet, The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel (Isaiah 7:14), which is being interpreted as God with us. Isaiahs prophecy is a confirmation that Jesus was called before birth. Joseph did not struggle; rather, Joseph was convinced of the angels vivid explanation about the child conceived by Mary. When he woke up, he did everything the angel had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. As a righteous man, he did not have any union with her until she gave birth to her Son and they named Him Jesus, as instructed by the angel (v. 21). There is no doubt that Joseph was obedient, righteous and a man of integrity and probity. Apart from the fact that he did not doubt the angels instructions in his dream, he had no sexual intercourse with Mary, even though they were under the same roof until she delivered the miracle baby. He also named the Child Jesus as directed by the angel. From all indications, it is obvious that for the work of our redemption, God did not choose men and women of shady characters as instruments. In fact, the benefits of obeying Gods instructions cannot be overemphasised. Both Mary and Joseph were found faithful, righteous and obedient. Thus they were counted worthy of being the family through which the Saviour of the world was born and nurtured to maturity. When we obey God and His instructions, He will be moved to bless us beyond our imagination. Some Christians, especially the young ones see obedience as a way to curb their freedom unlike Mary and Joseph who totally obeyed God and His plans for their lives was fulfilled.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

Their responses were astonishing; one of them said, I broke down in tears of joy and the other said, I received the good news with so much joy and excitement that I forgot to ask for the sex of the baby and even to take my car from the office to the hospital. The youngest father among them said, I left my station unannounced and without any money in my pocket. Naturally, the arrival of a new baby comes with great excitement and happiness, not only to the biological parents of the child but to neighbours, relatives, colleagues and well-wishers. Among Africans, the good news spreads fast and usually attracts celebrations to commemorate the arrival of the baby. The topic for todays Sunday school lesson is A Regal Response to Holy Light. As it was earlier prophesied that a Son (the Saviour) would be born by a virgin named Mary (Luke 1:31), it eventually came to pass and the good news spread all over the world. As a result, the magi came from the east by the leading of a star to Bethlehem to pay homage to Him. Although King Herod felt threatened with the coming of Jesus and made effort to kill Him, but the purpose of His coming was still fulfilled. The magi gave gifts and went back to their country through another route. In fact, their visit stresses the importance of the birth of the Messiah to the whole wide world.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Herods Secret Inquiry Matthew 2:7-10 People often do certain things without the awareness that though they can deceive humankind with their impure motives, they cannot deceive God. (1 Samuel 16:6). The birth of Jesus was widespread that even the magi (wise men who were experts in astrology) came from the East as they were led by a star to the city of Bethlehem, in search of the newborn King. According to verse 7, the magi were invited by King Herod and he secretly inquired from them the exact time the star appeared to them. He, thereafter, sent them to Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus and pretentiously said, Go and make a careful search for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him. (v. 8) Ultimately, the star led the magi to the place where Jesus was born and stopped, which by human standard signifies where the king is born. They were overjoyed when the star stopped; knowing that they had finally reached their destination with the excitement of seeing the longawaited Messiah 90 Usually, joy accompanies the fulfilment of ones expectation as the magi expressed in verse 10. But worthy of note in the passage is Herods insincere promise to also go and worship the newborn child when actually the birth of Jesus only intensified his fears and threat to his own reign. Interestingly, the magi followed the star to the manger and when the star stopped, they knew they had finally arrived at the right place. They were elated, knowing that their journey had not been in futility and that the long-prediction of the birth of a Messiah is fulfilled in their time. Human beings, no matter how intelligent or smart, cannot thwart the purpose of God in the life of His children. Although Herod had the intention of eliminating Jesus in order to retain power, but he failed. No wonder the Scripture says, The heart of man is desperately wicked, who can understand it, but the testimony is that all his devices failed and the divine plan of God was established.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

Jesus Receives Precious Gifts Matthew 2:11-15 The magi left King Herod and continued their journey to Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus, under the guidance of the star. When they entered into the house, they saw the child and Mary, his mother and they were overjoyed. In recognition of the fact that He is the Saviour, they knelt down and worshipped Him. They offered precious gifts that confirmed His call as a Prophet, Priest, and King before His birth. They offered: \u00b7 Gold, which speaks of His worth and as the King of Kings, it also represents His incorruptibility. \u00b7 Frankincense, which means Jesus priestly role as this was part of the incense burnt by the priest in the Holy Place. It is also a sweet smelling incense used in offering sacrifices. \u00b7 Myrrh represents His prophetic declaration and prediction of His sacrificial death. It is a perfume made from the hardened sap of a tree. After the presentation of the gifts, they returned to their country through another route, without going back to Herod as he requested, having been warned in a dream. Having known Herods plan to kill Jesus, an angel appeared to Joseph and instructed him to take the Child and His mother, Mary and escape to Egypt until the death of Herod. Again as a righteous man, Joseph obeyed. He took the Child and his mother, Mary and left for Egypt, they stayed there until Herod died (v. 15), in fulfilment of the Old Testament prophecy (Hosea 11:1) when the Lord said, Out of Egypt, I called my son. Christians can celebrate the birth of Jesus in various ways. We can give gifts of time, material things, prayers, and godly counsel to others. Ultimately, we can be determined to spread the good news of Jesus birth to people around our community. Notably, some things are paramount in the passage: the zeal of the magi who were involved in a great search for the newborn Child, the precious gifts they offered and the humility they demonstrated in worship. Furthermore, the obedience demonstrated by Joseph who was instructed in his dream to take the Child and his mother and escape to the land of Egypt and live there until the death of Herod. According to verse 19, after the death of Herod, an angel of the Lord appeared again to Joseph in a dream and ordered him to return to the land of Israel with the Child and his mother. During these movements, Joseph and Mary demonstrated obedience. They did not argue with each other at every revelation and decision time. They adhered to every instruction they received from the time Mary was found to be with Child to the time he was instructed to return to Israel, after the death of Herod. Each of the movements was ordered by God and fulfilled the prophecies made hundred years before.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.

I have been sent to prepare the way for the second coming of Jesus so that none will go to hell. When he was interviewed about his motivation, he explained that God spoke to him in his dream about the sins of the people of the state and the need for repentance. Despite the fact that many people made mockery of him with the claim that he was idle, the fairly aged man continued with the ministry for a long time until he became very old. He did not receive money or other material things from people throughout the period. The story of this man can be likened to the ministry of John the Baptist. John the Baptist started his public preaching ministry during a critical political period in the Roman Empire, during the time of Tiberius Caesar, while Pilate was the governor of Judea. The period was marked with lawlessness, insecurity, desecration of the priesthood office and secular corruption. However, it coincided with the fullness of time when God decided to implement the final part of His redemptive plan for humankind. At this time, John was in the wilderness when the Word of God came to him and God, therefore, commissioned him as a forerunner to prepare the way for the coming Messiah by proclaiming repentance and forgiveness of sin. Those who confessed their sins and repented were baptised. Johns message was important and timely, even though not many took him serious, just like it is today.<\/p>\r\n","lesson1":"<p>A. Johns Message of Repentance Matthew 3:1-6 The ministry of John the Baptist is significant in the ministry of Jesus. He was the one sent by God to prepare the way for the coming of the long-awaited Messiah.

He was the one spoken of through Prophet Isaiah when he said, A voice of one calling in the desert, Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him. (v. 3; Isaiah 40:3). The last few verses of Malachi predict the coming of another Elijah who would preach repentance in preparation for the day of the Lord. John was unique in his character, ministry and dressing. For instance: \u00b7 His clothes were made of camels hair like Elijahs (2 Kings 1:8), which probably portrays righteousness or vanity. \u00b7 He had a leather belt around his waist, perhaps a sign of his readiness for the ministry. \u00b7 His food was locust and wild honey, perhaps the only available food in the desert. \u00b7 People came to hear him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of Jordan. \u00b7 Those who confessed their sins were baptised by him in the River Jordan. The days of John the Baptist was known for lawlessness and insecurity. It coincided with the fullness of time when God decided to implement the final part of His redemptive plan. He was in the wilderness; a place of obscurity, when God called and saddled him with the responsibility to preach a message of repentance (the turning away from sin unto a life of righteousness with God, through faith in the sacrificial death of His Son, Jesus) to the people. Johns preaching was genuine and his emphasis was repentance (to make a radical change) because of the nearness of the kingdom of God, which will come with Gods wrath and judgment. He recommended that the people must turn away from their sins, change their hearts and live faithful lives. Otherwise, Gods judgment will come upon them. The climax of the story is that many people from Jerusalem, Judea and other parts of Jordan responded positively to his message. They confessed their sins and were baptised into the family of God. Unfortunately, these days many people resist the hearing of the Word of God with various excuses and sometimes make mockery of believers. They prefer to continually live in sin, without the consciousness of Gods plan to judge the world. Nevertheless, Johns proffered plan of escape from the wrath or judgment of God is still available for sinners who are willing to turn away from their sins and begin to live new lives in Christ.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time1":"<p>1.

Johns Firm Declaration Matthew 3:7-12 Johns message of repentance attracted many people to him, including the Pharisees and Sadducees. He, however, rebuked their hypocrisy and addressed them saying, You brood of vipers! (A symbol of deceit and cunning attitude). Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath and thereafter challenged them to bear fruits in keeping with repentance (vv. 7-8). John was firm in addressing the hypocritical lifestyle of the Pharisees and Sadducees who often presume that they are the people of God because they are descendants of Abraham (Genesis 17:7-8; John 8:33). Salvation does not come through birthright but by faith in Jesus (Romans 2:28-29). On the contrary, John made it clear that God can take stones and make them descendants of Abraham. However, he reminded them that Gods judgment is near and any tree that does not produce fruits will be cut down and thrown into the fire (v. 10; Matthew 7:19). According to verse 11, he acknowledged Jesus supremacy. Although he baptised with water, but Jesus would baptise with the Holy Spirit and with fire, which manifested on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:16-18). The day of final judgment and final separation will come when both the wicked and the righteous will be duly judged (v. 12). Johns confession in verse 11 is worth mentioning. Rather than claiming superiority with or over Jesus, he humbly recognised Him as the Messiah whose duty he is not qualified to perform. He confessed that he is only an emissary sent ahead of the coming Messiah. His duty, like that of Elijah and other prophets, was to call humankind to repentance, in preparation for the coming Messiah. Jesus did same but had also the power to judge humankind (v. 12). To avert this judgment was the reason He came to prepare the way for Him in the hearts of humankind. Even today, the message of repentance is needed so that humankind will hear and turn from their wicked ways unto God who gives eternal life.<\/p>\r\n","discussion_time2":"<p>1.
